This is a Live Firewall CD i called "Red Firewall", i am the author of it.<br />
Special thanks to my friends from the Perl Mongers Group (http://cafe.pm.org) for 
listening and inspiring me to add more features.<br />

<br />
The idea behind it is that you can have a gateway/firewall to Internet<br />
without a hard disk:<br />

Advantages:
<ul>
<li>Hacking proof - while it is a live usb/cd it manages a readonly medium and it is just a mather of rebooting</li>
<li>If there is a powercut, no problem, the hard disk would have no filesystem issues</li>
<li>Less costs of hard disk management</li>
</ul>

It is in BETA state, please download it and try it with your network interfaces,
if it do not recognizes them let me know.<br />
<br />

Be patient, do not think bad about me because it do not achieves your expectations, <br />
it is still under development in my spare time.<br /><br />
