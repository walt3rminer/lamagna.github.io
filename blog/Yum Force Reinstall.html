<div style="text-align: justify;">
Since Yum does not have a force flag, rpm commands must be 
used along with Yum to do some heavy lifting. Here are a 
few ways to force the reinstall of a broken package on a Yum Managed system.

<br />


<b>Yum Remove and then Install</b>
<br />

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The easiest solution is to yum remove the package 
and then yum install the same package. If there are 
too many dependencies at stake with the package in question, try another method.
</div>
<br />

<pre>
yum remove PACKAGE
yum install PACKAGE
</pre>

<br />
<b>Force Erase and then Yum Install</b>
<br />
RPM dependencies sometimes make a simple yum remove 
impossible and Yum will want to erase your entire OS 
before moving on. In this case, use rpm to force erase, then yum to install.<br />
<br />
<br />
<pre>
rpm -e --nodeps PACKAGE
yum install PACKAGE
</pre>
<br />

<b>Prune RPM Database and then Yum Install</b><br />

If your package install is so corrupted that an rpm -e is 
dangerous or impossible, even with --nodeps, remove the 
package from the local RPM database to trick yum into 
reinstalling the package. No files are deleted when using rpm -e with --justdb.<br />
<pre>
rpm -e --justdb --nodeps PACKAGE
yum install PACKAGE
</pre>
