<p> About 18 months ago I set up a Linux media server for my home. It was made from an old Dell desktop that my neighbor was (literally) discarding, and a pair of new, identical Seagate hard disks. Since I was going to be spending a lot of time copying my CDs to this server, I configured a RAID-1 array that mirrored the hard disks; that way, there would always be a current backup.

It&rsquo;s packed with diagnostic tools, such as hard disk testers, memory testers, etc. Run the appropriate one for your brand of hard disk, on each disk in the array. The Seagate tester I used lists the hard disks serial numbers, so there&rsquo;s no confusion once you open the case to remove the bad drive.<br /><br /><b><a href="#">keep reading... </a></b><div style="clear: both;"></div>
