<p><div style="text-align: justify;">The end of Wiki09 - Buenos Aires. The 3rd day of this international congress has always a party, and in this case it took place in Down Town, Buenos Aires. The party was in a nice &quot;Boliche&quot;, started a 22:00 and when we arrived there was a lot of people already, it is not a coincidence that the meeting had an incredible high number of german participants.<br /></div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">I was enchanted because i asked if i could go with my wife and on the Wiki09 they gave me a ticket for one peron more than me, this is worth to tell because i had to ask to know it, since it was not written anywere.<br /></div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The party was relaxing and it caused me a nice sensation while looking at all the people that participated from the Wiki09 in a different context. It is impossible to translate with words this emotion but i have to tell it, to invite anybody that may have the opportunity to go to Wiki10 for example (which is taking place in Poland) to participate.<br /></div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">On the meeting it was plenty of food, free drinks, ladies and music. It was a private event, but you could take a friend to the party.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">It was a special moment for me, those special moments you keep forever , by beeing with my wife in the party, with the peopele i have talked about evey day of these 4 days of event... and about the people that not only is on the media but also is influent, entrepreneur and may look different on the distance...Wikimedia Board members.<br /></div></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
