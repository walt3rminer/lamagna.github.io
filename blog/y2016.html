If you want to check from a script the state from the battery on the linux operating
system, it is as easy as looking this file:
<br /><br />
<pre>
cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity_level
Normal
</pre>

<br />
And this file gives the percentage of charge, in this example 97%:
<br /><br />
<pre>
cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity
97
</pre>

KeepassX is a graphical password management system, the webpage is <a href="https://www.keepassx.org/" target="_new">www.keepassx.org</a>
<br />
KeepassX webpage states: "KeePassX is an application for people with extremly high demands on secure personal data management. It has a light interface, is cross platform and published under the terms of the GNU General Public License."<br /><br />
These steps have been executed on a Debian 
Linux 8.6.0 but for an experienced System 
Administrator/Hacker this should be trivial.<br /><br />
You can look at older related posts:<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="Compile%20keepass%200.4.3%20on%20Debian%20Linux%20wheezy.html">how to install KeepassX 0.4.3</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wallves.com/blog/Compile%20keepass%202.0.2%20on%20Debian%20Linux%20Jeesie.html">how to install KeepassX 2.0.2</a></li>
</ul><br />

First you should have these packages installed:<br />
<pre>
apt-get install cmake g++ libqt4-core libqt4-dev libgcrypt-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev

</pre>
<br />
Now you can download the latest keepassX package and compile it:<br />
<pre>
wget https://www.keepassx.org/releases/2.0.3/keepassx-2.0.3.tar.gz
tar zxvf keepassx-2.0.3.tar.gz
cd keepassx-2.0.3/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
</pre>
<br />As root:<br />
<pre>
make install
</pre>
<br />

Now you could for example, add the access on a fluxbox window manager:


<br />
It works.<br />

<p id="postTitle"><a href="An%20additional%20LCD%20notebook%20monitor.html" id="alink">An additional LCD notebook monitor</a></p>

Once i had a notebook, it was red, lenovo, z80... rest in peace.  One day, after using
it helping at <a href="http://serfiscal.org/">an ONG Called Ser Fiscal</a> it started
with problems...  at that ONG i was helping with the independant control of the elections
documenting fraud and gave some technical assitance.  Some voluntary work.<br />
But after that point in time, something very bad started to happen with that notebook and
finally it never started again.  Of course i went to Lenovo here in Argentina, i do not know
now, i suppose it is not much different, but the official technical service told me that the
notebook was a rare model and they may not have the parts, in that case i would not have my
money back anyway... (yes, lets cry together with a cold beer).<br /><br />
Whathever, i wanted to recover something from the notebook, i could reuse the hard disk, i can
sell the memory, and i wanted to reuse the monitor (if possible).<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Step 1: Obtain the monitor code</b><br />
<br />
You will have to open the notebook, it is supposed to be broken anyway.  Be carefull,
you should extract the monitor, and take some pictures from the back.  Write down the numbers,
the seller will likelly ask you for them to confirm if he has the circuit for it.  If you
do not feel secure, ask a friend who may have more experience doing that.<br />
<img src="images/lcd1.jpg" width=300 height=300 />&nbsp;
<img src="images/lcd2.jpg" width=300 height=300 />&nbsp;
<img src="images/lcd3.jpg" width=300 height=300 /><br />
<br />
Save the pictures, the selled will likelly ask you for them.<br /><br />


<b>Step 2: Look for a selled of the circuit</b><br />
I obtained it at ebay, the article at that time looked like this:<br />
<img src="images/ebay1.png" width=300 height=250 /><br /><br />
I bought it from a selled called <a href="http://www.ebay.com/usr/xiongchun2013?_trksid=p2047675.l2559">xionchung2013</a><br />
This may sound like publicity, honestly i am just happy because i got the article and i had good
luck that it worked.  But you wouldn't believe the troubles i had.  In Argentina we had a not so nice
government from 2010 to 2015 and the possibility to import things, even they are not done here was arbitrary:
only people with friends in the government could do that, and you can imagine that somebody like me is
not the profile of somebody that makes friends with politicians.  Resuming, the selled sent the product and
it never arrived, luckyly it was returned to him, i had to pay him again for the delivery, and the
second time i contacted the postal office and followed like a crazy the package.<br /> Yes, lets
cry together again with a cold beer in a bar.<br /><br />

<b>Step 3: Connect it and use it!</b><br />
I have to post some pictures about how it looks like.  It is great!<br />
<br />

<b>Step 4: Enabling the secondary monitor in linux</b><br />
I have this script to enable the monitor in the office or at home:<br />

<pre>
walter@arsat:~$ cat monitors.sh 
#!/bin/bash

if [[ "$1" == "office" ]]; then
	xrandr --auto --output eDP1 --mode 1360x768 --left-of VGA1
else
# CASA
	echo "En casa";
	xrandr --auto --output VGA1 --mode 1920x1200 --left-of eDP1
fi;

In Windows 7 i created a large ZIP file (around 15 Gigas). I wanted to
move it to a linux machine and unzip it there.  But once in the linux 
machine, it produced this error:

<pre>

Hi, here is a very short list telling about how you can have
very easily a server withoug a monitor connected and manage it
with just few resources... a short post but without waste!<br /><br />

<b>Install headless lightdm with fluxbox and vnc</b><br />
<pre>
apt-get install lightdm
apt-get install fluxbox
apt-get install x11vnc
apt-get install xvfb
apt-get remove xserver-xorg-video*
</pre>

Now, you setup the SSH Server and connect creating a tunnel.<br /><br />

Once connected, in the Headless Server you type:
<br /><br />
<pre>
x11vnc -localhost -create -env FD_PROG=/usr/bin/fluxbox \
        -env X11VNC_FINDDISPLAY_ALWAYS_FAILS=1 \
        -env X11VNC_CREATE_GEOM=${1:-1024x768x16} \
        -gone 'killall Xvfb' \
        -bg -nopw
</pre>
<br />
And once the vnc server starts, you connect from your client through
a tunnel.<br /><br />
<pre>
vncviewer localhost:5900
</pre>

These steps have worked in Debian 8.0 Jessie.
<br />

Good, you are a Matlab user like me, but.. why are you willing to install it on a 
headless linux workstation ?  I thought i was the only person in the world doing that
but you reading this proves i am not alone...<br /><br />

<u>1) Well you mounted the iso image:</u><br />
<pre>
mount -o loop Matlab801_MacUnix.iso /mnt/cd
</pre>
<br />

<u>2) And tried to install but.... you are getting this</u><br />
<pre>
java.lang.InternalError: Can't connect to X11 window server using ':20.0' as the value of the DISPLAY variable.
        at sun.awt.X11GraphicsEnvironment.initDisplay(Native Method)
        at sun.awt.X11GraphicsEnvironment.access$100(Unknown Source)

        at java.lang.Class.forName0(Native Method)
        at java.lang.Class.forName(Unknown Source)
</pre>
<br />
<u>3) OPS! this should not be difficult you think...</u><br />
<pre>
#Try this...
install_linux -mode silent
#And this... 
install_linux -javahome /opt/java -mode silent
#And your DISPLAY variable is logically correct! because ...
printenv | grep DISPLAY
DISPLAY=:20.0
</pre>

The error message keeps displaying:<br />
<pre>
Error: The application encountered an unexpected error and needs to close.  You may want to try re-installing your product(s).  More information can be found at /tmp/mathworks_root.log
</pre>
<br />
And you are able to run any other X application, starting from xclock... but the Matlab install do not wants to start.<br />
Do not worry, it is not all lost.<br />
First, you will have to modify the install_linux shell script, but the image is readonly, so you will have to do a trick:
<br />
<u>4) First create a directory</u><br />
<pre>
mkdir /mnt/tmpcd
cd /mnt/tmpcd
</pre>
<br />
<u>5)  Copy there the install_linux script</u><br />
<pre>
cp /mnt/cd install_linux /mnt/tmpcd
</pre>

<u>6) Modify this line:</u><br />
<pre>
java_cmd="$java_exe -Xmx512m $XTRAFLAGS -Djava.ext.dirs=$JAR_SEARCH_PATH $JAVA_LAUNCH_TARGET -root \"$ROOT\" -tmpdir \"$TEMP_DIR\" -inputFile '$ROOT/install_ini_linux.txt' $arglist"
#
#And add this: "-Djava.awt.headless=true" It should look like this:
#
java_cmd="$java_exe -Xmx512m $XTRAFLAGS -Djava.awt.headless=true -Djava.ext.dirs=$JAR_SEARCH_PATH $JAVA_LAUNCH_TARGET -root \"$ROOT\" -tmpdir \"$TEMP_DIR\" -inputFile '$ROOT/install_ini_linux.txt' $arglist"
</pre><br />
<u>7) Now create a link to all the other files, i did it like this</u><br />
<pre>
# Being in /mnt/tmpcd
for i in /mnt/cd/*; do ln -s $i; done
</pre>
<br />
<u>8) Now you are ready! install it.</u><br />
