<h2 class="articleStrap">Hackers are unfit to serve as security experts</h2>Should we hire criminal hackers as security experts? This is the second of a <a href="#">two-part attack</a> on the idea from a 1995 debate in which I participated.<br /><br /> Consider the message you would be giving some thirteen year old proto-hacker. These kids, like most kids, are tremendously susceptible to peer pressure. They already find criminal hacking attractive because it&#39;s viewed as today&#39;s counter-culture &mdash; something fairly harmless (compared with, say, dealing drugs) but exciting because it&#39;s illegal.<br /><br /><b style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><a href="#">keep reading </a></b><br /><br /> The children and emotionally-arrested adolescents involved in criminal hacking already have a love/hate attitude towards The Man. Many of them claim that they&#39;d like to work for security firms when (if) they grow up. This myth that criminal hacking is a reasonable basis for work in security would become even more pernicious if it were known that more hackers had in fact been solicited and used by government or corporate organisations. Using such people would reinforce the attractiveness of criminality. <br /><br /><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><b><a href="#">keep reading</a></b><br /></div><div style="clear: both;"></div>
