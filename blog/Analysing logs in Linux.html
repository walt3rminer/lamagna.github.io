<p> Part of the security and sysadmins tasks is the log analysis and decision taking. There is plenty of information in <a href="#">http://www.linux.org/apps/all/Administration/Log_Analyzers.html</a>.<br /><br />The tools i recommend is called &quot;Lire&quot;, this tool permits the creation of several reporting formats, including html, pdf, xml, <a href="#">between others</a>. It also permits to analyze many log file formats, which include MySQL, Iptables, BIND, Apache, Qmail, Postfix, Syslog <a href="#">and more</a>. Lire is GPL&#39;ed Free Software (and Open Source), built around the idea of extendibility.<br /><br />This tool is available from http://www.logreport.org/lire, it has been deveploped in Perl and i recommend you to install all the dependence modules with CPAN (type &quot;perl -M CPAN -e shell&quot; on the command line as root). <div style="clear: both;"></div>
