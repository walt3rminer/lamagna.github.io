KeepassX webpage states: "KeePassX is an application for people with extremly high demands on secure personal data management. It has a light interface, is cross platform and published under the terms of the GNU General Public License."<br /><br />
These steps have been executed in Debian Linux 8.2.0 Jeesie but for an experienced System Administrator/Hacker this should be trivial.<br /><br />
Some time ago i explained 
<a href="Compile%20keepass%200.4.3%20on%20Debian%20Linux%20wheezy.html">how to install KeepassX 0.4.3</a>
but a newer version is available and i wanted to have it.<br /><br />

First you should have these packages installed:<br />
<pre>
apt-get install cmake
apt-get install g++
apt-get install libqt4-core
apt-get install libqt4-dev
apt-get install libgcrypt-dev
apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev
</pre>
<br />
Now you can download the latest keepassX package and compile it:<br />
<pre>
wget https://www.keepassx.org/releases/2.0.2/keepassx-2.0.2.tar.gz
tar zxvf keepassx-2.0.2.tar.gz
cd keepassx-2.0.2
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
</pre>
<br />As root:<br />
<pre>
make install
</pre>
<br />
