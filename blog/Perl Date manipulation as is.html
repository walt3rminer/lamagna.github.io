<p> Today i had to program a little script, in perl, and had to manipulate some dates.&nbsp; To convert the AM/PM part i used this previously written function (<a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>).<br /><br /> But then i need to do some delta operation on the dates, for whom i new packages like Date::Calc.<br /><br /> The surprise was that i couldn&#39;t install new packages in the server, it is a remote server and the less problems one causes, the better... because the server is shared, there was no gcc, bla, bla..<br /><br /> I found this package:<br /> use Date::Manip;<br /><br /> Which seems to be included with Perl.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t confirm it but it saved the day, here is an example:<br /><br /> my $ffin = &amp;DateCalc(&quot;$startdate&quot;, &quot;+8 days&quot;, \$err);<br /> my ($y, $m, $d) = $ffin =~ m/([0-9]{4})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2}).*/g;<br /><br /><br /> More about it:<br /> http://snowhare.com/utilities/perldoc2tree/example/Date/Manip.html<br /><br /><div style="clear: both;"></div>
