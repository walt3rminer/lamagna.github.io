<p> This happens when yum is unable to access its repositories.&nbsp; In Fedora 11 it can be resolved <a href="#">this was</a> but in Fedora 12 it happened to me that in my office i use a proxy to connect to Internet but not at home.&nbsp; So, you may have to set up a proxy in /etc/yum.conf or not.<br /><br /> To set a proxy modify /etc/yum.conf and add:<br /> proxy=http://the.proxy.address:8080/<br /><br /> This should be enough but you can also specify a user and password.<br /><br /> I hope it helped. <div style="clear: both;"></div>
