<p id="postTitle">Protecting your privacy while browsing</p>
 This is the first post related to privacy concerns in the Web.&nbsp; The Internet has changed a lot these years and i have the responsibility to share this little peace of wisdom.<br /><br /> The search engines and social networks are datamining all your movements, the reason, make money.&nbsp; There are no naives in the world any more, we all can imagine how they make money: selling your data and analysing it in other countries.<br /><br /> Fighting for your privacy is something that nobody will do for you, if you do not protect yourself, nobody will.&nbsp; I tell this from experience, i live in Argentina so i know what i am talking about.<br /><br /> Every webpage has today a facebook or a g+ or any kind of ad-ons, every web page you visit is reporting other private companies about your movements&nbsp; / beheavior / interests and you may not want that.... but you have to know that it is happening.<br /><br /> I recommend you to use Firefox, with the adblock plugin, and then you can&nbsp; <br /> enable these resources: http://adversity.uk.to/<br /><br /> I tested it, and it blocks for example &quot;google analytics&quot;, every webpage has it today, but its subproduct is your behavior.<br /><br /> Another good free plugin for firefox is https://www.ghostery.com/, seems effective. <div style="clear: both;"></div>
