<p><br /><br /> After upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04.1 the machine hung after s very short passage through an attempt to start the graphical interface.&nbsp;&nbsp; With some luck, i pressed ctrl+alt+f1 to be on the terminal and avoided to use the graphics, hence avoided the crash.&nbsp; But i would recommend you to just start with a live cd and mount the filesystem.<br /><br /> I found this in the /var/log/kern.log .<br /><br /> After googling and looking at a lot of suggestions, what worked for me was:<br /><br /> apt-get install nvidia-331<br /> apt-get remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau<br /><br /> vi /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-graphics-drivers.conf<br /><br /> blacklist nouveau<br /> blacklist lbm-nouveau<br /> blacklist nvidia-173<br /> blacklist nvidia-96<br /> alias nvidia nvidia-current<br /><br /> This will do it (or most likely should).&nbsp; Then you may have issues with the desktop that do not starts.. but that may be another story. <div style="clear: both;"></div>
