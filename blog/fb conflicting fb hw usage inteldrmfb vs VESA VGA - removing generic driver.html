After upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04.1 the machine hung after a very short 
passage through an attempt to start the graphical interface.&nbsp;&nbsp; With some 
luck, i pressed ctrl+alt+f1 to be on the terminal and avoided to use 
the graphics, hence avoided the crash.&nbsp; But i would recommend you to just start with a live cd and mount the filesystem.<br />
<br />
 I found this in the /var/log/kern.log .<br />
<br />
 After googling and looking at a lot of suggestions, what worked for me was:<br />
<br />
 apt-get install nvidia-331<br />
 apt-get remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau<br />
<br />
 vi /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-graphics-drivers.conf<br />
<br />
<pre>
blacklist nouveau
blacklist lbm-nouveau
blacklist nvidia-173
blacklist nvidia-96
alias nvidia nvidia-current
</pre>
<br />
 This will do it (or most likely should).&nbsp; Then you may have issues with the desktop that do not starts.. but that may be another story. <div style="clear: both;"></div>
