In Windows 7 i created a large ZIP file (around 15 Gigas). I wanted to
move it to a linux machine and unzip it there.  But once in the linux 
machine, it produced this error:


<pre>
unzip Windows\ 7\ Clone.zip                          
Archive:  Windows 7 Clone.zip
warning [Windows 7 Clone.zip]:  15415149290 extra bytes at beginning or within zipfile
  (attempting to process anyway)
error [Windows 7 Clone.zip]:  start of central directory not found;
  zipfile corrupt.
  (please check that you have transferred or created the zipfile in the
  appropriate BINARY mode and that you have compiled UnZip properly)
</pre>

After trying some things i resolved it like this:<br />

<pre>
7za x Windows\ 7\ Clone.zip
