<p> I installed Suse 10.1 in my laptop, this is a real peace of heaven, i love it. I like the installation (targeted for the general public, not only specialists) and Novell knows what the administrators and normal users want, and that is simplicity, easy to learn and manage. Suse Linux do not installs selinux by default or LVM like Fedora, i like this and the explanaitions given by Novell for doing so.<br /><br />Now i want to see mpeg in my Suse 10.1, you will not be able to see them by default, you will need to use the program &quot;yast&quot; to install needed packages that do not come by default.<br /><br />1) Run yast as root user, and add a new source for the installation, add the pacman repository:<br />Link: http://en.opensuse.org/Additional_YaST_Package_Repositories<br />Add the pacman repository<br /><br />2) Execute: <span style="font-family: courier new;">yast -i kaffeine-mozilla</span><br /><br />This will install win32 drivers to see mpeg and DVD, also Kaffeine player.<br /><br />Please, write here your opinion about Suse Linux or other distros. <div style="clear: both;"></div>
