Once i had a notebook, it was red, lenovo, z80... rest in peace.  One day, after using
it helping at <a href="http://serfiscal.org/">an ONG Called Ser Fiscal</a> it started
with problems...  at that ONG i was helping with the independant control of the elections
documenting fraud and gave some technical assitance.  Some voluntary work.<br />
But after that point in time, something very bad started to happen with that notebook and
finally it never started again.  Of course i went to Lenovo here in Argentina, i do not know
now, i suppose it is not much different, but the official technical service told me that the
notebook was a rare model and they may not have the parts, in that case i would not have my
money back anyway... (yes, lets cry together with a cold beer).<br /><br />
Whathever, i wanted to recover something from the notebook, i could reuse the hard disk, i can
sell the memory, and i wanted to reuse the monitor (if possible).<br /><br />
<br />
<b>Step 1: Obtain the monitor code</b><br />
<br />
You will have to open the notebook, it is supposed to be broken anyway.  Be carefull,
you should extract the monitor, and take some pictures from the back.  Write down the numbers,
the seller will likelly ask you for them to confirm if he has the circuit for it.  If you
do not feel secure, ask a friend who may have more experience doing that.<br />

<img src="images/lcd3.jpg" width=300 height=300 /><br />
<br />
Save the pictures, the selled will likelly ask you for them.<br /><br />


<b>Step 2: Look for a selled of the circuit</b><br />
I obtained it at ebay, the article at that time looked like this:<br />
<img src="images/ebay1.png" width=300 height=250 /><br /><br />
I bought it from a selled called <a href="http://www.ebay.com/usr/xiongchun2013?_trksid=p2047675.l2559">xionchung2013</a><br />
This may sound like publicity, honestly i am just happy because i got the article and i had good
luck that it worked.  But you wouldn't believe the troubles i had.  In Argentina we had a not so nice
government from 2010 to 2015 and the possibility to import things, even they are not done here was arbitrary:
only people with friends in the government could do that, and you can imagine that somebody like me is
not the profile of somebody that makes friends with politicians.  Resuming, the selled sent the product and
it never arrived, luckyly it was returned to him, i had to pay him again for the delivery, and the
second time i contacted the postal office and followed like a crazy the package.<br /> Yes, lets
cry together again with a cold beer in a bar.<br /><br />

<b>Step 3: Connect it and use it!</b><br />
I have to post some pictures about how it looks like.  It is great!<br />
<br />

<b>Step 4: Enabling the secondary monitor in linux</b><br />
I have this script to enable the monitor in the office or at home:<br />

<pre>
walter@arsat:~$ cat monitors.sh 
#!/bin/bash

if [[ "$1" == "office" ]]; then
	xrandr --auto --output eDP1 --mode 1360x768 --left-of VGA1
else
# CASA
	echo "En casa";
	xrandr --auto --output VGA1 --mode 1920x1200 --left-of eDP1
fi;

</pre>
