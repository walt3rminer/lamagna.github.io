<p> A good place for security education is the SANS/FBI site (<i class="emphasis"><a class="url" href="#" target="_top">http://www.sans.org/top20/</a><span class="url">). These are the most important Unix related security issues:<br /><span style="font-size:100%;"><br /></span><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-family:arial;">1. Web Server. One of the places that an intruder is going to check first is for vulnerabilities in your Apache version and in you cgi-scripts.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">2. Remote Procedure Calls. RPC Services should be down if they are not required, they allow a remote user to execute instructions in your computer; the intruder usualy gains root access this way.</span><br /><br /></span></span></i><span style="font-size:100%;"><i class="emphasis" style="font-family:arial;"><span class="url">3. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). This protocol is known to have had its vulnerabilities and their password can be easily cracked and more easier captured from the network.<br /><br /></span></i></span><i class="emphasis"><span class="url"><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-family:arial;">4. SSH (Secure Shell). SSH has been exploited before, if you do not need it then you can turn it off, or filter the source ip addresses with </span><a href="#" style="font-family: arial;">TCP Wrapper</a><span style="font-family:arial;">.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">5. Remote Services (Trusted host). This was a setup in the machines based on the rely of other machines IP address, and leaved access without asking password. Their binaries are &quot;rsh&quot;, &quot;rcp&quot;, &quot;rlogin&quot; and &quot;rexec&quot;. They exist and can be used also today, the attacked can do a party with your machine if they use a technique known as &quot;ip spoofing&quot;.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">6. FTP (File Transfer Protocol). Many vulnerabilities have been found in FTP, as exploits and protocol weaknesses, like clear text password transfer (resolved in SFTP).</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">7. LPD (Line Printer Daemon). This daemon is also remotely exploitable with help of an overflow and a shellcode, gaining root access if the server is running as root.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">8. BIND/DNS (Dynamic Name Server). DNS Flooding, exploits and other attacks are available, if you are going to set up a DNS, use a firewall to filter any port that you do not want.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">9. Sendmail. This mail transfer agent is known for its buffer overflows and remote exploits, though it has resolved its issues, always appears something new. It is recommended to use qmail.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">10. Weak Password / No Passwords in the system. I do not need to explain this.</span><br /></span><br />Many people that talk about security talk about a false sense of security that one can have in the cyberspace, i do not totaly agree with them, i see very often thay it is created a false sense of insecurity also. The items i have listed before create some sense of insecurity and alert; but do not worry, if you are going to run one of this critical services, just keep in mind:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:100%;"><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">* Use a <span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">well configured</span></span> firewall (pay more attention to &quot;well configured&quot; than &quot;firewall&quot;)</span><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">* Set up <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);font-size:130%;">correctly</span> an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System.</span><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">* Ask for help a security professional, here in Argentina we have very good ones :-)</span></span><br /></span></i><div style="clear: both;"></div>
