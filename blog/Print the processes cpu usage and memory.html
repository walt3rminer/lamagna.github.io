<div id="section"><p id="postTitle">Print the processes cpu usage and memory</p>
<p> In linuxforum was asked this and i found it interesting to resolve, he needed to list the processes ordered by CPU and memory usage in Linux. My resolution was this:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">ps -eo pcpu,pid,user,args,pmem | sort -k 1 -r | head -10</span><br /><br />And if you want to have a terminal listing it you can use this line:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">for i in `seq 1 10`; do ps -eo pcpu,pid,user,args,pmem | sort -k 1 -r | head -10; sleep 1; clear; done</span><br /><br />I hope it was usefull. <div style="clear: both;"></div>
