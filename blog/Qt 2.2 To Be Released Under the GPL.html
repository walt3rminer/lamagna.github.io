<p> I use KDE or Gnome, kde is more mature than gnome but its downside is that it is not free license and the user that used KDE was not completly free though he was using Linux.<br /><br />Not Qt (the libraries from KDE) are free, that that means a step forward in freedom.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Link:<br /><a href="#">http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/180/</a><br /><br />Leave your comment!<br /></span><div style="clear: both;"></div>
