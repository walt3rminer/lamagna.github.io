 LVM is a Logical Volume Manager for the Linux operating system. There are now two version of LVM for Linux: <br /><ul><li> LVM 2 - The latest and greatest version of LVM for Linux. <br /> LVM 2 is almost completely backward compatible with volumes created with LVM 1. The exception to this is snapshots (You must remove snapshot volumes before upgrading to LVM 2) <br /> LVM 2 uses the device mapper kernel driver. Device mapper support is in the 2.6 kernel tree and there are patches available for current 2.4 kernels. <br /><li> LVM 1 - The version that is in the 2.4 series kernel, <br /> LVM 1 is a mature product that has been considered stable for a couple of years. The kernel driver for LVM 1 is included in the 2.4 series kernels, but this does not mean that your 2.4.x kernel is up to date with the latest version of LVM.</ul><a href="#">Keep reading the second part</a><br /><ul></ul><div style="clear: both;"></div>
