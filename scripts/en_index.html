<b>Migrate from blogspot.com to your own site</b><br /><br />
<pre>
I created this script because i needed to migrate my blog from
blogspot, i wrote for 10 years and it is a lot of content to do it
manually.  I tested a few programs that existed already, on Internet, i
do not remember their name in this moment, but even they tell they do 
what i need, the reality is that they did not worked  to the date (Decembr 2014).
In my mean times i started doing this project that may be usefull to other
people.
<br />
<br />
These two scripts prepare the html from the blog, obtained from blogspot,
and to make it work statically, without needing external images.
<br />
<br />
Welcome are questions or possible improvements, because i could test it just a little.<br />
