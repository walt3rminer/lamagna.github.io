 World Source   Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry      1982/10/02    The world of gas is distant, difficult and far flung. In &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; to look at a contentious &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; energy producing area.   One of the sites I visited was a local &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; of the &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation.   But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge:&lt;/b&gt; one man (one of the richest individuals in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it.   But as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies.   It seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; fantasy industry.   By the early 1970s, a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances.   Under his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield. You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city. But &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt recommending the best ways of ensuring that &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; continues to produce energy for decades to come.   The easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; techniques, such as the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;hyper&lt;/FONT&gt;-&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;acid&lt;/FONT&gt;ic &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;substrate&lt;/FONT&gt; removal techniques developed by the company in 1974.   So thanks to clever people such as &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.

 International Times Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry   2 October 1982  The world of gas is distant, difficult and far flung. In &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; to look at a contentious &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; energy producing area.

As I remember it, a former trucker was in charge. It was a vivid example of how a once small exploration company from Thethys had begun to grow into a mighty international force in the energy industry. But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge:&lt;/b&gt; one man (one of the richest individuals in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it.

Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. From what's developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with abundant natural resources.  Centrum developed world class expertise in engineering in very difficult surroundings  When I was a young &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt;spaperman on the Daily Record in Glasgow in the early 1970s, the great off-shore oil rush was beginning in the North Sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies. It seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; fantasy industry. Much to his mother's regrets, meanwhile, &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; had started prospecting in the early 1960s. By the early 1970s, a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances. Under his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield. It now has thousands employees and operates in numerous countries.  The change in Centrum has been substantial. You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city. And as you drive round Centrum, almost every roundabout is sponsored by a division of GAStech.  &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; has recently started paying more attention to leisure activities and philanthropy, allowing his son &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; Jr. and co-founder &lt;b&gt;Hank&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; to run the company.

&lt;hr /&gt;
 The Continent  The central role of the center in industry of the gas Tethan     1982/10/03   The world of gas has been thrown far, with difficulty and far. Suffered in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; a couple year, reiste I moeizaad to the distant gasvelden of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; to examine causing area a controversial &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; energy.  An one of the places which I was room &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; of the &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; company of the gas has visited, volgestopt=wordt= which reinforced the werklaarzen and overall and the chemical products and the supply with you must put gasverrichting in functioning. Since I remind it, a former truck driver was responsible.  It was a living example of how an once small exploration company of Thethys in a powerful international strength in the energy industry had started grow.  But I had had concerning the meeting have to forgotten to I to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; the other day for the first time for their early years, to reacquaint with the man who the matter creerde, &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; returned: one people (one of the richest individuals in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;) that by the whole tale of gas zoekend to floor treasures have lived and of thrived strongly.  But since I for the capital which of center went people interviews, I realized shortly that this not only tale of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; energy was. Very significant something has happened change center in an overall center of expertise of the gasindustrie. Of what becomes in the capital is developed there important lessons for other places holy (and are cursed which) with abundant natural wealth.  The center developed expertise of world class concerning technique in very difficult surroundings  Then I young &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt;spaperman on the daily report in Glasgow in the early seventies were, started the large for the coast oliestormloop in the North sea. Then a rather impossible dream, which an island changes of coal in a place with abundant oil and gaslevering, seemed.  It seemed to our on the west coast of shot country that the much thrown city of center, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; a beetje for its laarzen large got, believe which in the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; fantasieindustrie start.  Much to the spite of its mother, in the meantime, &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; was to floor treasures zoeken in the early sixties started.  By the early seventies, a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; gasbedrijf, GAStech started, with its wegkolos-als progress.  Under its cautious accompaniment, GAStech in an important supplier of aardgas to the local area evolved, and then much further far gone. It has now thousands employees and works in many countries.   The change in center has been considerable. YOU notice them in the constant cheap goods of helicopters aan-ing-en fro-ing to afgelegen areas, and the planes which are alternatively established at the airport of the city to shuttle execs of the city.  And since you float for center, each rotonde is almost sponsored by a department of GAStech.   &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; have recently started more attention to free time activities and philanthropy to spend, which is &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; strict permits of Jr. of zoonsSten and of the cofounder put the company in functioning. But &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; have been asked net submit a report for the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt Tethan which to look recommends the best manners that &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; energy for. decades continue cause to come  Gemakkelijk-aan-krijg material have been produced, so that loving the gas will &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;demand&lt;/FONT&gt; next much investment and nicer &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; techniques, such as &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;hyper&lt;/FONT&gt;-&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;acid&lt;/FONT&gt;ic the techniques of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;substrate&lt;/FONT&gt; disposal which are developed by the company in 1974.   This way thanks to nice people such as &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; and people whom with him work, the center has reached what each place where the raw materials lung are discovered to do. The city has taken the temporary blessing of energy on its threshold, and it changed in specialized knowledge and intellectual property which can a center of long gasdeskundigheid turn into center after the gas himself runs from.   
&lt;hr /&gt;
 Everyday &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;New&lt;/FONT&gt;s  Central paper of the center in the industry of the gas of Tethan     1982/10/03   The world of the gas distant, difficult and is thrown far. In &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; some years ago, I traveled laborious to the gas fields moved away of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; to watch a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; debatable area of the energy production.  One of the sites that I visited was a local &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; of the company of the gas of &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge,&lt;/b&gt;  finessed with the shippers of the work and the reinforced covers and the chemical agents and the sources you need to work an operation of the gas. Like it memory, a previous truck driver was responsible.  It was an alive example of how a once small reconnaissance company of Thethys had begun to grow in a powerful international force in the industry of the energy.  But it had forgotten to me on the encounter until I again went to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; the other day for the first time from its years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge:&lt;/b&gt; a man (one of the richest individuals of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;) who has lived with the whole history of the gas that prospected and has prospered powerfully of him.  But like I was around the capital city of the people who entrevistaba with of the center, soon I made that this was not right a history of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; energy. Something very significant has happened to give return to the center in a global center of the masters of the industry of the gas. Of what it is developed in the capital city are important lessons for other places blessed (and it cursed) with the abundant natural resources.  The center developed masters of the class of the world in directing in the very difficult environs   When it was &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt;spaperman young in the daily file in Glasgow at the beginning of years 70, the great attacks coast outside of the oil began in the North Sea. Then it looked like a pretty impossible dream, giving returned to an island of the coal in a place with the abundant sources of the oil and gas.  It was looked like us in the coast of the west of Scotland that the city far thrown of the center, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; was able to great small piece for its shippers, beginning to believe in a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; industry of the fantasy.  Much to the grief of its mother, meanwhile, &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; had begun the prospection in early years 60.  By early years 70, a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; company of the gas, GAStech, began his monster-like advances.  Under its direction canny, GAStech was developed in an important &lt;b&gt;jet&lt;/b&gt; of the natural gas to the local region, and later it foments much to the distant spot. Now it has employees of the thousands and it works in numerous countries.   The change in center has been substantial. You notice in the constant uproar of helicopters to-Ing. and fro-Ing. towards it go to the moved away areas, and the planes aligned in the airport of the city to backwards go and execs forwards and of the city.  And as you lead around the center, almost each traffic circle is sponsored by a division of GAStech.   &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; has recently begun to pay more attention to the pastimes and filantropia, allowing that its &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;hank&lt;/b&gt; of the Jr and the Co-founder of &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; of the son directs the company. But &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; finishes requesting itself to produce a report for the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of Tethan that recommends the best ways to make sure that &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; continues producing the energy per decades to come.  The matter of easy-to-obtaining has taken place, so to keep to come from the gas it will need much investment and &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; rea&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;r techniques, such as the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;hyper&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;acid&lt;/FONT&gt; techniques of the retirement of the substratum developed by the company in 1974.   It so thanks for ready people as &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; and the people who work with him, center has reached what wishes each place in where the raw materials are discovered to do. The city has taken the temporary favor from the energy in its threshold, and it has given to return in the specialized knowledge and the intellectual characteristic him that can make center a center of masters of the long gas after the gas itself works towards outside.   </event>

 World Journal  The central role of the centrum in the gas industry of Tethan     1982/10/04   The world of gas is distant, difficult and vast. In &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; a few years ago, I travelled laboriously to the remote gas layers of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; to look at a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; controversial sector of energy production.  One of the sites which I visited was a local &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; of the gas company of &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge,&lt;/b&gt;  lined initializations of work and reinforced combinations and the chemicals and the provisioning you must run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former truck-driver was responsible.  It was a sharp example in the way in which a company of exploration once small of Thethys had started to develop in a powerful international force in the industry of energy.  But I had forgotten the meeting until I would have gone again in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; the other day for the first time since their first years, with the reacquaint with the man who created the businesses, &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge:&lt;/b&gt; a man (one of the richest individuals in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;) which lived by the whole history of prospecting gas and thrived strongly of him.  But while I went around the capital city of the interviewing people of centrum, I realized soon that it was not simply a history of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; energy. Something very significant A precisely proves to transform the centrum into total center of expertise of gas industry. Of what is developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with the abundant natural resources.  The centrum developed the expertise of class of the world while machinant in very difficult environments   When I was a young journalist on the daily disc in Glasgow at the beginning of the Seventies, great oil precipitations at sea began North at sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, transforming a coal island into place with the abundant gas and oil provisioning.  It seemed with us on the Western coast of Scotland that the vast city of the centrum, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; obtained with a little large for its initializations, starting to believe in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; industry of imagination.  Much with the regrets of his/her mother, while waiting, &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; had begun the prospection at the beginning of the Sixties.  With the beginning of the Seventies, a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; company of gas, GAStech, began the sound truck-like advances.  Under its careful councils, GAStech was transformed into an important supplier of natural gas to the local area, and then much further with far. It now has employees of thousands and functions in many countries.   The change of the centrum was substantial. You note them in the constant basic image of the helicopters to-ing and of fro-ing outside to the areas moved away, and had aligned them with the airport of the city to make the shuttle of the execs in the two directions of the city.  And while you lead around the centrum, almost each round not is financed by a division of GAStech.   &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; recently started to pay more attention to the activities of leisures and philanthropy, allowing its Jr. and &lt;b&gt;hank&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; de wire &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; of cofounder to direct the company. But &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; was right guest to produce a report/ratio for the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of Tethan recommending the best manners of securing than &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; continuous to produce energy during decades to come.

   World Journal  The perspicacity of an expert: prosperity as foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;PRESIDEN&lt;/FONT&gt;T in Kronos   2014/03/26 January 17, 1995    The &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;hank&lt;/b&gt; is &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;PRESIDEN&lt;/FONT&gt;T de GAStech, the principal industry of Krono during more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gas layers close to the town of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.  &lt;b&gt;Fluss,&lt;/b&gt;  functioned with dozen foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;ts during years. However, it has humble beginnings as a gas and oil prospector in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;.   It spoke at times about the features about a chief successful in Kronos and which foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;ts can envisage in the market.   Q: What the foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;ts can they wait when they come in Kronos?  A: the economic environment changed since the Eighties. It is much more difficult to succeed today. The foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;ts must play in bottom of their hopes. There is no easy victory in Kronos. Competition among Kronosian and foreign companies is hard. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the spirits of the population.  But there is less of difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of word. The personnel of Kronos function just like hard, they are respectful of their work and have the same desire for success. They can also appreciate the effective communication and a gifted chief.  Which foreign chief must make is to learn how to communicate the manner of Kronosian and to take time to include/understand their personnel.  Q: Can you work out?  A: There are many cultural differences while communicating. [To consider] notes. The foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;ts are always confused and frustrated when they send a note [with somebody in Kronos] and expect a simple response of yes/No Instead of that they obtain a very long answer which does not answer their initial question.  The people of Kronos do not like to take the responsability. They are frightened to lose their work and do not like to be forced in saying something which they do not want with. The foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;ts must take account of this and have to take time to include/understand how to communicate.  Patience is key. Transparency can be an excellent manner of coming to end this. It is a European value which Kronosians are very sensitive to. To impose on a company can transform with the voyage of a foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;t into Kronos an experiment much more pleasant.  Q: What the challenges of force are they a foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;PRESIDEN&lt;/FONT&gt;T can they face on the arrival in Kronos?    A: Sometimes in fact the simplest things can be most provocative, like obtaining from A with B in a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;tax&lt;/FONT&gt;i. To be able to obtain around easily is taken for granted and not being able to make thus creates a great direction of the insecurity. In Kronos you are never sure if your driver drops to you to far with the address envisaged. This can seem as a small question but daily it is very tiring.  Another ends up knowing your team and with which you work. Just often foreign of stage of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;ts in addition to plane and in an &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; completely of the colleagues of Kronos. They do not have any idea which they are, how they work or as they qualified are. This can be muddling.   The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;ts must take time to speak with their personnel, of the administrators to the drivers of truck and to include/understand their &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; environment before they test them and control.  Q: Can you give some ends on the way in which a foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;PRESIDEN&lt;/FONT&gt;T can prepare?  A: the first thing that I would say is to prepare your family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; environment of operation. This can affect the personal life. The family and the work of mixture are practical very current here. The people of Kronos work of overtime and socializes with their colleagues. It is very different from &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; where there is a clear border between work and the family.  The foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;ts should also carry out how hard competition is and how much hard work must be put inside to succeed -- often much more than in their countries of origin. The language is a great question.  [But] anyhow much prepare you, the true experiment to work and to live in Kronos will always astonish you.  Q: How much difficult - or easy - is it to be a foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;PRESIDEN&lt;/FONT&gt;T in Kronos?  A: Generally, I think that being a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;PRESIDEN&lt;/FONT&gt;T is hard. There is much pressure, the environment is hard and it is difficult to find a balance with your personal life.  When a team of Kronos hears them that a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;PRESIDEN&lt;/FONT&gt;T comes from overseas suppose it is a problem. But, culturelement they do not have a question with foreigners.   Q: Are there situations in which to be a foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;director&lt;/FONT&gt; is really an advantage?  A: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to include/understand the country and the culture. If they do not make any effort locate then it is a Net handicap. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as the goods of luxury, the foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;ts can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process.  Sometimes the foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;PRESIDEN&lt;/FONT&gt;T with the best knowledge of an industry and can bring the access to the markets of overseas. This can be a tangible asset.

   Everyday &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;New&lt;/FONT&gt;s  Penetration of an expert: prospering like foreign CEO in Kronos   2014/03/26 17 of January of 1995    The &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;hank&lt;/b&gt; is CEO of GAStech, main industry of Krono by more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gas fields near the city of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.  &lt;b&gt;Fluss,&lt;/b&gt;  has worked with dozens of foreign CEOs on the years. Nevertheless, it has humble principles like prospector of the oil and the gas in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;.   He spoke to the times on the characteristics of a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt; guessed right in Kronos and what foreign CEOs can hope in the market.   Q: What can foreign CEOs wait for when it comes to Kronos?  A: The economic atmosphere has changed from years 80. He is much more hard to be successful today. Foreign necessity of CEOs to play under its expectations. There are no easy triumphs in Kronos. The foreign competition between Kronosian and companies are resistant. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the minds of the population.  But there is less difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of the opinion. The personnel of Kronos works hardly like hardly, she is respectful of her work and has he himself desire for the success. Also they know to appreciate to the efficient communication and a talented &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;.  What foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt; needs to do it is to learn how to communicate the way of Kronosian and to take time to understand its personnel.  Q: Can you elaborate?  A: There are many cultural differences in communicating. [Considerar] the notes. Foreign CEOs always confused and is frustrated when somebody in Kronos sends a note [] and counts on a simple answer of yes/no. In place they obtain a very long answer that it does not answer its initial question.  The people of Kronos do not have taste to take responsibility. They scare it to lose his works and she does not have taste of being forced in saying something that it does not wish a. Foreign necessity of CEOs to take this in consideration and to need to take the time to understand how to communicate.  The patience is key. The transparency can be an excellent way to obtain around this. It is an European value that Kronosians is very responsivo a. The imposition of him in a company can make the trip of a foreign CEO in Kronos a much more pleasant experience.  Q: Which is the challenges of the pipe a foreign CEO can do in front on arrival in Kronos?    A: It is sometimes the simplest things that they can be desafiadoras, like obtaining of A to B in a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;tax&lt;/FONT&gt;i. The power to obtain around is taken easily for granted and not being able to do so it creates a great sense of the insecurity. In Kronos you never are safe if his conductor falls to him dull in the feasible line. This can look like as a small edition but on a daily base is very annoying.  Another one is becoming familiar with its equipment and with whom you are working. The often foreign right of the passage of CEOs of the plane and in an &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; completely of the fellow workers of Kronos. They do not have any idea that is, how they work or how they are described are. This can be confused.     Q: Can you give some extremities in how a foreign CEO can prepare yourself?  A: The first thing that would say is to prepare its family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; surroundings of work. This can affect personal life. The family and the work who mix themselves are practical very common here. The people of Kronos work in extra hours and socialize with her colleagues. It is very different from &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; where there is a clear limit between the work and the family.  Foreign CEOs must also make how he is resistant is the competition and how much hard work must be put inside to be successful -- often much more that in its countries of origin. The language is a great edition.  [But] does not concern you at the most is prepared, the true experience of the work and to live in Kronos it will always surprise to him.  Q: How difficult - or easy - is to being a foreign CEO in Kronos?  A: Generally, I think that being a CEO he is hard. There are many of pressure, the atmosphere is resistant and is difficult to find a balance with its personal life.  When an equipment of hears them to Kronos that a CEO is coming from overseas assumes is a problem. But, cultural they do not have an edition with the foreigners.   Q: Hay the situations in which the foreign executive being is really an advantage?  A: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and the culture. If they do not deliver any attack then to locate he is a net one harms. But in certain negotiations or certain editions such as luxury merchandize, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process.  The foreign CEO has better knowledge of an industry and can sometimes bring the access to the overseas markets.

   The Continent  The insight of an expert: thriving as foreign CEO in Kronos   2014/03/26 17 January 1995    The strict &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; are CEO of GAStech, the important industry of Krono more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gasvelden near the city of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.  &lt;b&gt;Fluss,&lt;/b&gt;  have worked with dozens of foreign CEOs in the course of the years. However, he has records beginning as oil and gasprospector in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;.   He spoke to The Times concerning the appetites of a successful &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;LEADER&lt;/FONT&gt; in Kronos and which foreign CEOs in the market can expect.   Q: What is possible foreign CEOs when they to Kronos expects come?  A: The economic environment has changed for the eighties. It is succeed much today more with difficulty. Foreign need CEOs their minimize expectations. There are easily none wins in Kronos. The competition under Kronosian and foreign firma's is tough. It is difficult the harten and win the opinions of the population.  But there is less difference than people between culture Kronosian think and, culture says Tethian. The staff work of Kronos like only hard, is they respectful of their work and has same the wish for success. They know also it how at to appreciate efficient communication and a gifted &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;LEADER&lt;/FONT&gt;.  What a foreign &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;LEADER&lt;/FONT&gt; must do is learns how at to communicate Kronosian to the manner and time to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;demand&lt;/FONT&gt; to understand their staff.  Q: Can you develop?  A: There are a lot of cultural differences in communicating. [Think] after memoranda. Foreign CEOs have been always confused and frustrated when they send a memorandum [to someone in Kronos] and simple ja/nee expect answer. In place of it they become a very long answer to that their initial question does not answer.  People of Kronos love the no responsibility to take. They are do be scared to lose their job and do not love in saying something are forced they to wants. Foreign need CEOs this take into account and the time to have &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;demand&lt;/FONT&gt; to understand how at to communicate.  Patience is very important. Transparency can be an excellent get manner around this. It is a European value that Kronosians to very receptive is. Imposing in a company can turn foreign CEO into the travel in Kronos a more pleasant experience.  Q: What are the most important challenges foreign CEO can on arrival in Kronos under eyes see?    A: Sometimes it is the simple things that can be the challenge, such as getting A to B in a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;tax&lt;/FONT&gt;i. Are able round to be easily taken for granted and cannot do creert this a large meaning of uncertainty. In Kronos are you never certainly as your driver you on the planned address sale. This is possible if a small question seems but on a daily basis it is very tiring.  Another get to know your team and which you work with. Frequently foreign CEOs staprecht of the plane and in an &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; peak of employees Kronos. They have no idea that they are, how they work or how qualified they are. This can be confusing.   The need of CEOs &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;demand&lt;/FONT&gt; the time to speak for their staff, of the administrators for the truck drivers and their &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; environment to understand before they try and them lead.  Q: Can you give a couple ends on how foreign CEO can preparations make?  A: The first thing which I am your prepare family would say. They can find it difficult to adapt to the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; work surroundings. This can influence it personal life. Mixing family and the work is here very common practice. People of Kronos work overtime and socialiseren with their colleagues it is very differing from &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; where there is a clear border between the work and family.  Foreign CEOs also must realize how tough are the competition and how much hard work must be introduced to succeed -- frequently much more than in their birth country. The language is a large question.  [But] no question how much you prepare, real experience will surprise in Kronos to work and live you always.  Q: How difficult - or easy - is it for foreign CEO in Kronos to be?  A: Generally, think I am CEO hard am. There is a lot very, is the environment tough and it is difficult find a balance with your personal life.  When a team hears Kronos that CEO come assume from overseas she is it a problem. But culturally they have no question with aliens.   Q: There are situations in which it are a foreign staff employee in fact an advantage is?  A: This question depends really on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and culture. If they make no effort then to localize is it a net disadvantage. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as luxegoederen, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring to a another view, the process to facilitate.

When we made contact with enemy with the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; of &lt;b&gt;Sarto&lt;/b&gt; of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;minister&lt;/FONT&gt; for the commentary, he said, we were astonished by the results of the survey on recent GAStech of the curve of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele.&lt;/b&gt;  I mean, this I am hardly enormous for the people of Kronos. We have already undertaken several great projects of the improvement like the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;harbor&lt;/FONT&gt; extension and the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;hospital&lt;/FONT&gt; that we could not of another way to do due to the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;tax&lt;/FONT&gt;es that we are seeing of our foreign investments. These &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt;s almost assure to us will be able to harvest those same dividends per decades to come     They are evident that the plan of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;t &lt;b&gt;Araullo&lt;/b&gt; to deceive the foreign investment has been a little while that it defined in our history. One hopes that those that had been so myopic as far as they oppose his plan finally have come to their senses. We will say which is too proud to say: Thanks, Mr. &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;t.

One hopes that they those this way shortsighted had been are themselves resist plan definitively to their meanings have come.

 Homeland Illumination &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, KRONOS: A TOWN IN NEED, Part One Petrus Gerhard 19 March 1998  This article is the first installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos. &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; River, the sun rises over the farming town of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt. Bouro. Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos. Two weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; Bend. In his email he described a once bountiful region now distressed by &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ation, struggling to find solutions to a worsening problem. I decided to investigate.  We didn't make the connection at first, Reese told me when I met with him at his &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt;. The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away. After a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production. We thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better. Then when the kids started getting &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;sick&lt;/FONT&gt; we took a harder look at what could have changed.  The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; Jr, a business tycoon out of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;. Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;. The two founders - &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; Sr and &lt;b&gt;Hank&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; Sr into an early grave and drove &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; into a marginal role in his own company. With the death of &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;. With a population of 6500, most residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; live in one- and two-story houses on small farms. A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a cafe where you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home. Families have lived in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; for generations.  We've made a good living for a long time, Reese tells me. The population has been steadily increasing. Crop production has been good. For the most part, kids haven't left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural places. We have a lot of land that could yet be developed. There was a future for them here.  I asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations. He introduced me to a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.  I caught up with &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; in town making purchases at the &lt;b&gt;Osvaldo&lt;/b&gt; hardware store to repair a broken tractor. &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm. Part Two will be published April 25, 1998 </event>

 The Orb  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, KRONOS: A CITY IN the NEED, part one    1998/03/20   This article is the first installment of a series in three parts addressing the problem growing of an anguish of the community, the embezzlement of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt, and influences it alarming at the multinational multinationals on the country of Kronos.  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, Kronos - nested in the curve of the river of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele,&lt;/b&gt;  the sun rises surplus the cultivatrice city of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, driving out far the shades masking the millitorr close Bouro. Today, because they have daily during more than 250 years, the residents will rise to tighten the rich ground of floodplain which provides the food for the people of Kronos.  Two weeks before I received an email of an old friend, Pondo Reese, maintaining the writer of the weekly &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt;spaper of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, a paper of agriculture serving the community around the curve of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele.&lt;/b&gt;  In its email it described once beneficial area now afflicted by the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ation, fighting to find solutions with a problem of deterioration. I decided to study.   We did not draw up the report/ratio at the beginning, Reese said to me when I met him at his &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt;. The gas company had been back of a few years established in '94, and our problems did not start immediately. After a couple of the harvests, we saw a decline in the production. We thought that perhaps it was right a hoquet, and the things would be better. Then when to fall started with problem childs threw us a harder glance with what could have changed.   The change proved to be international GAStech, an international company directed by &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; Jr, a big businessman of businesses out of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;.  Bench in 1961, the company of GAStech started like businesses had by family providing of the local services of haulage in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;. The two founders - Sr and &lt;b&gt;hank&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; de &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; - wild drilling found with being more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and scandals financial which ran thereafter Sr of &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; in a tomb early and led &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; in a marginal role to its own company. With the death of Sr of &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge,&lt;/b&gt;  the son took the bar of GAStech firmly in his catch and widened his influence further with far, thereafter unloading with the threshold of the small peaceful black suburbs of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.  With a population of 6500, the majority of the residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; live in houses one and of two-history to small farms. A smaller number of families live in the black suburbs along a principal street with two markets, two stores of material, a gas station and a coffee where you can buy the lunch, take your mail and buy one liter of milk to bring the house. The families lived in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; for generations.   We made for a long time a good life, Reese says to me. The population had firmly &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt;d. The vegetable production was good. For the majority, the children did not leave for the city as they have in many of other rural places. We have much ground which could still be developed. There was a future for them here.   I asked Reese to help me to meet the people whose lives were carried out by the operations of GAStech' S. It presented to me at a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.   I caught up with myself compared to &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; downtown making of the purchases to the store of material of &lt;b&gt;Osvaldo&lt;/b&gt; to repair a broken tractor. &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; cultivated soya its life whole, just as his/her father and their fathers. I questioned it about his life with the farm.  The part two will be published on April 25, 1998

 The Wrap  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, KRONOS: A CITY IN NEED, part     1998/03/21   This Article is the first advance of a three-part range the tackling growing problem of one fear of the community, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt indictable offense, and the alarming influence of multinational companies on the country of Kronos.  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, Kronos - Nestled in the bending of the river &lt;b&gt;Tiskele,&lt;/b&gt;  the sun &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt; concerning the agriculture city of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, gone pursuing those surrounding Mt shadow. Bouro cloaking. Today, since they each day more than 250 years, the residents will &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt; to tend that the rich alluvial area country feeding for people of Kronos supplies.  Two weeks in former days I received a e-mail of an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; weekly day book, an agriculture document that the community serve round bending &lt;b&gt;Tiskele.&lt;/b&gt;  In its e-mail he described an once abundant area that now it is agitated by pollution, which solutions to a worsening problem wrestle to find. I decided to examine.  We did not make the connection firstly, Reese told me then I him on its &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; met. The gasbedrijf built a couple had been year back in 94, and our problems had started not rechtsweg. After a couple harvests, we saw a fall in production. We thought perhaps the only hiccup were, and improve the things would become. Then the young young she-goats &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;sick&lt;/FONT&gt; to be then started took we a harder can at what could changed be.   The change proved to be international GAStech, an international company that by &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; Jr, bedrijfstycoon from &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; in functioning are put.  Established in 1961, the company GAStech started had as a family matter which grants the local exchanging services in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;. The two founders - SR and strict &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; van &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; - found more profitable onbetrouwbare drilling to be, and started this way with a range environment calamities and financial scandals which &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; eventual SR in an early sepulchre in functioning floated stalks and &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; in a marginal role in its own company. With the death of &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; SR, the zoon took the rudder firmly of GAStech in its seizure and broadened its influence further far gone, eventually landing at the threshold of the small peaceful municipality of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.  With a population of 6500, the most of residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; one imagine oneself themselves and twee-verhaal live on small agriculture companies. A smaller number of families lives in the municipality along a head street with two markets, two hardware rises, one gaspost and a cafe where you buy lunch, can take your mail and a liter buys milk to house to bring. The families have lived in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; for generations.  We have made a good for a long time living, Reese tell me. The population gestadig have &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt;d. The production of the plant has been well. Mainly, the young young she-goats have not left for the city since they have a lot in other rural places. We have a lot country which could be still developed. There was a future here for them.  I asked Reese me to help people meet it of who life has been influenced by the verrichtingen of GAStech. He introduced me to a farmer of whom family had been here for different generations.   I obtained &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; which in city in purchases make at the hardware rise of &lt;b&gt;Osvaldo&lt;/b&gt; to repair a broken motor tractor. &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; have soya broad beans complete life have been treated, such as its father and their fathers.

Two weeks I previously received an email of an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the weekly &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt;spaper of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, a paper of the agriculture that served to the community around the curve of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele.&lt;/b&gt;  In his email it described once generous region now caused sorrow by the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ation, fighting to find solutions to a worsening problem. He decided to investigate.   We did not make the connection at the outset, Reese we said to me when I satisfied with him in its &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt;. The company of the gas had been posteriora part of some years constructed in '94, and our problems did not begin immediately. After a pair of harvests, we saw a declination in the production. We think that perhaps hiccup was right, and the things would obtain better. Then when obtaining begun the cabritos ill we done one more a glance harder what could have changed.   The change turned out to be international GAStech, an international corporation directed by &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; Jr, tycoon of the business outside &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;.  Established in 1961, the corporation of GAStech began like had business family who provided services that carried the premises in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;. Both founders - Mr. and &lt;b&gt;hank&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; de &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; - perforating savage found to being more lucrative, and began therefore a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that worked Mr. de &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; in an early tomb and lead possible &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; in a marginal paper in their own company. With the death of Mr. de &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge,&lt;/b&gt;  the son took the rudder from GAStech firmly in his grasping and widened his influence more far to the distant spot, possible landing in the threshold of small the Pacific municipality of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.  With a population of 6500, most of the residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; they live in houses one and on two-history in small farms. A smaller number of families lives in the municipality throughout a main street with two markets, two warehouses of the hardware, a powerboat and a coffee where you can buy lunch, take his mail and buy a liter of milk to bring the home. The families have lived in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; for the generations.   We have made a good life during long time, Reese we say to me. The population has been increasing constantly. The vegetal production has been good. For most, the cabritos have not gone away for the city as they have in many of other rural places. We have many of earth that could still be developed. There was a future for them here.   I requested Reese to help me to satisfy the people who lives have been affected by the operations of GAStech. It introduced a farmer to he who family had here been for several generations.   I took for above with &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; in the city that made purchases in the warehouse of the hardware of &lt;b&gt;Osvaldo&lt;/b&gt; to repair an broken tractor. &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; has cultivated the soybeans its whole life, like its father and his parents.

I decided to investigate.  We didn't make the connection at first, Reese told me when I met with him at his &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt;. The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away. After a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production. We thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better. Then when the kids started getting &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;sick&lt;/FONT&gt; we took a harder look at what could have changed.  The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; Jr, a business tycoon out of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;. Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;. The two founders - &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; Sr and &lt;b&gt;Hank&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; Sr into an early grave and drove &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; into a marginal role in his own company. With the death of &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;. With a population of 6500, most residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; live in one- and two-story houses on small farms. A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a cafe where you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home. Families have lived in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; for generations.  We've made a good living for a long time, Reese tells me. The population has been steadily increasing. Crop production has been good. For the most part, kids haven't left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural places. We have a lot of land that could yet be developed. There was a future for them here.  I asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations. He introduced me to a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.  I caught up with &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; in town making purchases at the &lt;b&gt;Osvaldo&lt;/b&gt; hardware store to repair a broken tractor. &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm. Part Two will be published April 25, 1998

 The Orb  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, KRONOS: A CITY IN the NEED, part one    1998/03/20   This article is the first installment of a series in three parts addressing the problem growing of an anguish of the community, the embezzlement of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt, and influences it alarming at the multinational multinationals on the country of Kronos.  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, Kronos - nested in the curve of the river of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele,&lt;/b&gt;  the sun rises surplus the cultivatrice city of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, driving out far the shades masking the millitorr close Bouro. Today, because they have daily during more than 250 years, the residents will rise to tighten the rich ground of floodplain which provides the food for the people of Kronos.  Two weeks before I received an email of an old friend, Pondo Reese, maintaining the writer of the weekly &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt;spaper of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, a paper of agriculture serving the community around the curve of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele.&lt;/b&gt;  In its email it described once beneficial area now afflicted by the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ation, fighting to find solutions with a problem of deterioration. I decided to study.   We did not draw up the report/ratio at the beginning, Reese said to me when I met him at his &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt;. The gas company had been back of a few years established in '94, and our problems did not start immediately. After a couple of the harvests, we saw a decline in the production. We thought that perhaps it was right a hoquet, and the things would be better. Then when to fall started with problem childs threw us a harder glance with what could have changed.   The change proved to be international GAStech, an international company directed by &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; Jr, a big businessman of businesses out of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;.  Bench in 1961, the company of GAStech started like businesses had by family providing of the local services of haulage in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;. The two founders - Sr and &lt;b&gt;hank&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; de &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; - wild drilling found with being more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and scandals financial which ran thereafter Sr of &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; in a tomb early and led &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; in a marginal role to its own company. With the death of Sr of &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge,&lt;/b&gt;  the son took the bar of GAStech firmly in his catch and widened his influence further with far, thereafter unloading with the threshold of the small peaceful black suburbs of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.  With a population of 6500, the majority of the residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; live in houses one and of two-history to small farms. A smaller number of families live in the black suburbs along a principal street with two markets, two stores of material, a gas station and a coffee where you can buy the lunch, take your mail and buy one liter of milk to bring the house. The families lived in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; for generations.   We made for a long time a good life, Reese says to me. The population had firmly &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt;d. The vegetable production was good. For the majority, the children did not leave for the city as they have in many of other rural places. We have much ground which could still be developed. There was a future for them here.   I asked Reese to help me to meet the people whose lives were carried out by the operations of GAStech' S. It presented to me at a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.   I caught up with myself compared to &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; downtown making of the purchases to the store of material of &lt;b&gt;Osvaldo&lt;/b&gt; to repair a broken tractor. &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; cultivated soya its life whole, just as his/her father and their fathers. I questioned it about his life with the farm.  The part two will be published on April 25, 1998

 Homeland Illumination &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, KRONOS: HELP FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE Part Two Petrus Gerhard 25 April 1998  This article is the second installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos. I caught up with &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; in town making purchases at &lt;b&gt;Ferro&lt;/b&gt; Hardware store to repair a broken tractor. &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.  We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more, &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size. Over the years we've added a few hectares here and there. It keeps us busy.  Busy is an understatement, as I found when I prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more.  I usually head to the fields before sun up, Mr. &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; tells me. My wife gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside me until dinner. When the children get home from school they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most times by dark.   We do this most days, he adds, except for worship days.  &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; identifies the appropriate bolt and chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes his purchase.  We all know one another here, &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; explains as we leave. Most families have lived here for generations. The first &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; people that came to town were with that gas company that built a few years back.  I ask &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; if business has been good.   We were doing pretty good until recently. Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment. Then we started having all this trouble with the crops.  In what way, I asked.  The crops aren't producing like they have in the past. It took a while to figure out, then one of the city &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt;rs figured out to call in a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; specialist. When they tested it they said the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; was &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ated.  Bodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had to head back home. The tractor had to be fixed before they could work the next day. I thanked him and watched him climb into his truck and head out of town. The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; specialist turned out to be the international agency &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Wellness&lt;/FONT&gt; For All , an international agency with a mission to bring healthy &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development. I caught up with a representative from &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Wellness&lt;/FONT&gt; for All the next day. &lt;b&gt;Joclyn&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; is project coordinator for &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Wellness&lt;/FONT&gt; for All . She spoke to me over a satellite call from her field &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; in Southeast Asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. Ms. &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.  We were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt;. In the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen. The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; drinking &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; comes from the &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; River, as does all the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; for farming, so we looked for a source upstream. We found sources of production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream. Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins.   Can these substances occur naturally? I asked her.  Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly. Ground&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ation is usually the result of human activity. The GAStech pipes are releasing &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ants into a pond. The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; River from which the residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; draw their drinking &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; and irrigation for the crops.   Did you talk to GAStech about this?   Oh yes, she replied. At first we believed we were gaining traction. We met several times with GAStech representatives, including one of the senior executives, &lt;b&gt;Hank&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fluss.&lt;/b&gt;  He personally assured us GAStech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts. After a time, though, it became clear that while Mr. &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; was earnest it was &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; who makes the decisions. It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, or the environment.  &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge,&lt;/b&gt;  Jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices.  When we didn't make headway with GAStech, &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; continued, the community &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;s decided to approach the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of Kronos for assistance. Per our policy -and with permission from the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;s - we published the test results in an official public document. The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;s then approached the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis. Our agency assured them we would again be available to help in any way when those agreements were finalized.  At this point Ms &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; was called away from the phone, so I returned to my editor friend, Pondo Reese to tell finish the story. Part Three will be published May 15, 1998

 Daily Pegasus  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, KRONOS: A CITY IN the NECESSITY, divides one    1998/03/21   This article is the first installation of a series of three parts that deals with the problem every greater time an anguish of the community, the criminal fact of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations in the country of Kronos.  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, Kronos - Nestled in the curve of the river of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele,&lt;/b&gt;  the sun rises excessive the city that cultivates of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, persecuting far the shades that disguise TM. next Bouro. Today, as they have &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt;spaper by more than 250 years, the residents will rise to tend to the rich Earth of floodplain that provides the food for the people of Kronos.  Two weeks I previously received an email of an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the weekly &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt;spaper of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, a paper of the agriculture that served to the community around the curve of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele.&lt;/b&gt;  In his email it described once generous region now caused sorrow by the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ation, fighting to find solutions to a worsening problem. He decided to investigate.   We did not make the connection at the outset, Reese we said to me when I satisfied with him in its &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt;. The company of the gas had been posteriora part of some years constructed in '94, and our problems did not begin immediately. After a pair of harvests, we saw a declination in the production. We think that perhaps hiccup was right, and the things would obtain better. Then when obtaining begun the cabritos ill we done one more a glance harder what could have changed.   The change turned out to be international GAStech, an international corporation directed by &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; Jr, tycoon of the business outside &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;.  Established in 1961, the corporation of GAStech began like had business family who provided services that carried the premises in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;. Both founders - Mr. and &lt;b&gt;hank&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; de &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; - perforating savage found to being more lucrative, and began therefore a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that worked Mr. de &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; in an early tomb and lead possible &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; in a marginal paper in their own company. With the death of Mr. de &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge,&lt;/b&gt;  the son took the rudder from GAStech firmly in his grasping and widened his influence more far to the distant spot, possible landing in the threshold of small the Pacific municipality of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.  With a population of 6500, most of the residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; they live in houses one and on two-history in small farms. A smaller number of families lives in the municipality throughout a main street with two markets, two warehouses of the hardware, a powerboat and a coffee where you can buy lunch, take his mail and buy a liter of milk to bring the home. The families have lived in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; for the generations.   We have made a good life during long time, Reese we say to me. The population has been increasing constantly. The vegetal production has been good. For most, the cabritos have not gone away for the city as they have in many of other rural places. We have many of earth that could still be developed. There was a future for them here.   I requested Reese to help me to satisfy the people who lives have been affected by the operations of GAStech. It introduced a farmer to he who family had here been for several generations.   I took for above with &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; in the city that made purchases in the warehouse of the hardware of &lt;b&gt;Osvaldo&lt;/b&gt; to repair an broken tractor. &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; has cultivated the soybeans its whole life, like its father and his parents. I asked to him about its life in the farm.  Part two will be published the 25 of April of 1998   </event>

I asked him concerning its life on the agriculture company.   We the country has for a long time worked - perhaps 200 years, perhaps told a beetje more, &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; me since he picked crap concerning a container of, which zoeken to the correct size. In the course of the years we a couple has here and there added hectaren. It occupies our.  Busy is a understatement, since I found then I the wiry farmer to tell me to porde more.  Leads I usually omhoog to the areas by sun, M. &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; tells me. My woman becomes omhoog the young young she-goats and heading to school, then they little something for us for lunch will turn to eat and beside me into diner to work. When the children recover house of school they pass their jobs, and we are all at the house the most of times dark.  We do this the most days, he adds, except worship days.  &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; identify the suitable bolt and chatter with the cashier concerning young young she-goats and school since he are completes purchase.

First &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; people who came to city were with that gasbedrijf that a couple year back. built  I ask &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; if the matter has been well.   We did to recently free good. The profits were well and we add surface, or promote material. Then started we have all this problem with the plants.  On which manner, I asked.  The plants do not produce if they have in the past. It took one tijdje to calculate, then one of the town civil servants who are calculated to obtain a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; specialist. Then they tested it they said &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt;. polluted was  Bodrodgi which are sighed, and with a besieged can in its eye he me for my interest thanked and he told had lead me behind to house. The motor tractor had be confirmed before they the next day could work. I thanked him and paid attention to him climb in its truck and head from city.  The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; specialist appeared the international agency &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Wellness&lt;/FONT&gt; for all, an international agency with a task healthy bring &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; to communities to which by natural disasters it are agitated, drawing and - accidentally - oil and gasontwikkeling.  I obtained a representative of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Wellness&lt;/FONT&gt; in for already next day. &lt;b&gt;Joclyn&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; are project coordinator for &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Wellness&lt;/FONT&gt; for all. They spoke to me concerning a satellite question of its area &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; in South-East Asia where she was the efforts of the establishment aid after a earthquake. Mej. &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; came to me for a couple speak minutes between meetings concerning their work in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.  We were contacted by a town civil servant concerning a problem they with their room &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; had. In the last years agriculture had collapsed, and the by-effect of certain &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;sick&lt;/FONT&gt;nesses and birth shortages had &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt;d. The drinking &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; comes from the river &lt;b&gt;Tiskele,&lt;/b&gt;  like already &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; for agriculture, so that upstream we zochten a source. We found sources of the disposal of the production detritus upstream at the GAStech verrichting km . The tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other things toxin.   Are possible substances these? of course prevention I asked her.  Not in these amounts, and not this sudden. The pollution of the ground&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; is usually the result of human activity. Blow GAStech release polluting substances of a pond. The toxin to form subsurface plucks which trickles in the river &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; of which the residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; their drinking &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; and irrigation for the plants. to draw  You spoke to GAStech concerning this?  Yes, she answered Oh. We believed firstly we tractie reached. We met representatives GAStech, including one including the higher staff employees, several keren strict &lt;b&gt;Fluss.&lt;/b&gt;  He insured our personal GAStech would act responsibly to assist material and financial to cleaning turn effort. After a time, nevertheless, it became clear that whereas M. &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; were serious the &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; were those decisions take. It is clear that he [Sanjorge] no interest in the well-being of the residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, or environment. has  &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge,&lt;/b&gt;  Jr., which had its share in the company of its father in 1990, geerftf, a reputation for cutthroat company practices had developed.  Then we made no progress with GAStech, continuously &lt;b&gt;Reynolds,&lt;/b&gt;  the Community &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;LEADER&lt;/FONT&gt;s decided for aid the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of Kronos to approach. By our policy - and with authorization of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;LEADER&lt;/FONT&gt;s &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; - we published the test results in an officially public document. The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;LEADER&lt;/FONT&gt;s &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; approached then the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt civil servants as citizens of a community Kronesian which is armed with the scientific analysis. Our agency insured them we again its available anyway would help then those agreements became gebeeindigd.   On this point Mej. &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; as from the tel. were called, so that I returned my redacteursvriend, Pondo Reese to tell the tale to finishing.

 Daily Pegasus  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, KRONOS: AID of one divides two of the SOURCE UNEXPECTED    1998/04/27   This article is the second installation of a series of three parts that deals with the problem every greater time an anguish of the community, the criminal fact of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations in the country of Kronos.  I took for above with &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; in the city that made purchases in the warehouse of the hardware of &lt;b&gt;Ferro&lt;/b&gt; to repair an broken tractor. &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; has cultivated the soybeans its whole life, like its father and his parents. I asked to him about its life in the farm.   We have worked the Earth during long time - perhaps 200 years, perhaps a small piece more, &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; said to me as it chose on a package of per to us, looking for the right size. On the years we have added some hectares here and there. To us it maintains occupied.   Occupied it is an underestimation, as I found when I punctured to farmer wiry to say to me more.   My wife obtains the ascending cabritos and title to teach, then she will do a little something so that we eat for the lunch and we work next to me until supper. When the children obtain school caretakers make their tasks, and we are all buttocks in the house most of the times by darkness.    We do this most of the days, he we added, with the exception of days of the adoration.   &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; identifies the appropriate bolt and to char it with the teller on cabritos and school whereas it finishes his purchase.   All we know one another one here, &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; we explained whereas we go away. Most of the families they have lived here for the generations. The first &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; people who came to the city were with that company of the gas that constructed the posteriora part of some years.   I request &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; if the business has been good.    We made quite good recently until time. The benefits were good and added cultivated area, or &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt;d the equipment. Then we began to have all this hardship with the harvests.   How, I it requested.   The harvests are not producing as they have in the past. It awhile took the figure towards, outside then one of the calculated officials of the city towards outside calling in a specialist of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt;. They proved when it they said that the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; was &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ated.   Bodrodgi sighed, and with a glance surrounded in its eye thanked for he me by my interest and this it had to me to direct it the back home. I thanked for it I watched and to raise it in its car and head outside city.  The specialist of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; turned out to be the international agency health for all , an international agency with a mission to bring the healthy &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; to the communities caused sorrow by natural disasters, sketch and - coincidently - oil and development of the gas.  I took for above with a representative of the health for all the following day. &lt;b&gt;Joclyn&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; is coordinating of the project for the health for all . She spoke to me on a call based on the satellites of her &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; of the field in Asia South-Eastern where she was efforts of the relevacion of the creation which they followed an earthquake. Ms &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; decided to speak me by some minutes between the meetings on its work in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.   A civil employee of the city on a problem we made contact with enemy whereupon they had with its local &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt;. In years of last agriculture one had collapsed, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had risen. The potable &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; comes from the river of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele,&lt;/b&gt;  like all the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; to cultivate, so we looked for a source against the current. We above find sources of the useless disposition of the production in km of the operation of GAStech by &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt;s. The tests demonstrated to stops levels of the benzene, the tolueno, arsenic of xylene, the lead and the selenium, among other toxins.    These substances Can happen naturally I asked to him.   Not in these amounts, and not this one suddenly. The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ation of the underground &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; is generally the result of the human activity. The pipes of GAStech are sending the polluting agents in a pool. The toxins are forming plume subsurface that leaks in the river of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; of which the residents of the drainage of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; its potable &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; and irrigation for the harvests.    You spoke with GAStech on this    Oh yes, she answered. We thought at the outset that we gained the traction. We solved several times with the representatives of GAStech, including one of the senior executives, &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;hank.&lt;/b&gt;  It assured personally to us that GAStech would act responsible to provide material and financial aid towards efforts of the cleaning. After a time, although, got to be clear that whereas Mr. &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; was serious it was &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; that makes the decisions. It is evident that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest in the well-being of the residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, or the atmosphere.   &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge,&lt;/b&gt;  the Jr, who had inherited his part in the company of his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for the practices of business of cutthroat.   When we did not make progress with GAStech, &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; continued, the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;s of the community decided to approach the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of Kronos for the aid. By our policy - and with the permission of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;s of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; - we published the test resultses in an official public document. The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;s of then &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; approached the officials of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt like citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the scientific analysis. To our he assured them agency that we would be again available to help anyway when those agreements were concluded.   To this point the &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; far from the telephone called ms, so I returned to my friend of the editor, Pondo Reese to tell to end history.  Part three will be published the 15 of May of 1998

 The Orb  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, KRONOS: HELP of an UNEXPECTED part two of SOURCE    1998/04/27   This article is the second installment of a series in three parts addressing the problem growing of an anguish of the community, the embezzlement of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt, and influences it alarming at the multinational multinationals on the country of Kronos.  I caught up with myself compared to &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; downtown making of the purchases to the &lt;b&gt;ferro&lt;/b&gt; store of material to repair a broken tractor. &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; cultivated soya its life whole, just as his/her father and their fathers. I questioned it about his life with the farm.   We worked the ground for a long time - perhaps 200 years, perhaps a little more, &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; like it indicated to me selected above a container of bolts, seeking the good size. During years we added a few hectares here and there. It maintains occupied to us.   Occupied is an undervaluation, as I found when I stabbed the stiff farmer to say myself more.   Of I head usually to the fields before the sun to the top, Mr. &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; indicates to me. My wife obtains the high children and titrates to inform, then it will do something so that us eat for the lunch and function beside me until the dinner. When the children become at the house of the school they make their drudgeries, and we are all backs at the house the majority of the times by the darkness.    We make these majority of the days, it is added, except days of worship.   &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; identifies the suitable bolt and causes with the cash clerk about the children and of the school while it achieves his purchase.   All let us know We here another, &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; explains while we leave. The majority of the families lived here for generations. The first &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; people who came to the city were with this gas company which established the back of a few years.   I ask &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; if the businesses were good.    We made very good until recently. The benefit were good and we add cultivated surface, or improve the equipment. Then we started to have all this trouble with harvests.   How, I asked.   Harvests do not produce as they have in the past. That removed one moment with the figure, then one of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;s of city illustrated outside to call in a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; specialist. When they examined it they said that &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; was soiled.   Bodrodgi sighed, and with a glance encircled in its eye it thanked me for my interest and says had it to me to direct the back house. The tractor had to be fixed before they could function the next day. I thanked it and observed it rise in its truck and head out of the city.  The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; specialist proved to be the international agency health for all , an international agency with a mission to bring healthy &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; to the communities afflicted by normal disasters, outlines and - coincidentally - oil and formation of gas.  I caught up with myself compared to a representative of health for the whole the next day. &lt;b&gt;Joclyn&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; is a coordinator of project for health for all . It spoke to me above a satellite call its &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; field in South-East Asia where it was efforts of relief of establishment following an earthquake. Mrs. &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; agreed to speak to me during a few minutes between the meetings about their work in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.   We were contacted by a civil servant of city about a problem which they had with &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; their room. In years of the last agriculture was effondue, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had gone up. The drinking &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; comes from the river of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele,&lt;/b&gt;  just as any &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; for the leasing, thus we sought a source upstream. We found sources of provision of reject of production to the km of operation of GAStech ascending. The tests showed the high levels of benzene, toluene, the xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, between other toxins.    Can these substances occur naturally? I asked him.   Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly. The subsoil &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ation is usually the result of the human activity. The pipes of GAStech discharge from the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ants in a pond. The toxins form a feather with ground flower which infiltrates in the river of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; of which residents of the aspiration of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; their drinking &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; and irrigation for harvests.    You spoke in GAStech on this subject?   The OH yes, it answered. In the beginning we believed that we gain traction. We met several times with representatives of GAStech, including one of the senior executive, &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;hank.&lt;/b&gt;  It personally ensured us that GAStech would act in a responsible way to provide to the material aid and financial worms of the efforts of cleaning. After one moment, although, it appeared clearly that while Mr. &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; was serious it was &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; which makes the decisions. It is obvious that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest for the wellbeing of the residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, or environment.   &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge,&lt;/b&gt;  Jr., which had inherited its share to the company of his/her father in 1990, had developed a reputation for pitiless procedures of management.   When we did not make progress with GAStech, &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; continued, the chiefs of the community decided to approach the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of Kronos for the assistance. By our policy - and with the permission of the chiefs of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; - we published the test results in an official public document. The chiefs of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; then approached the civils servant of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt as citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the scientific analysis. Our agency ensured that we would be still available to help in some way when these agreements were completed.   In this moment Mrs. &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; was called part of the telephone, thus I returned to my friend of writer, Pondo Reese for saying to completion the history.  The part three will be published on May 15, 1998 </event>

 Homeland Illumination &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, KRONOS: HELP FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE Part Two Petrus Gerhard 25 April 1998  This article is the second installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos. I caught up with &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; in town making purchases at &lt;b&gt;Ferro&lt;/b&gt; Hardware store to repair a broken tractor. &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.  We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more, &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size. Over the years we've added a few hectares here and there. It keeps us busy.  Busy is an understatement, as I found when I prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more.  I usually head to the fields before sun up, Mr. &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; tells me. My wife gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside me until dinner. When the children get home from school they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most times by dark.   We do this most days, he adds, except for worship days.  &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; identifies the appropriate bolt and chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes his purchase.  We all know one another here, &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; explains as we leave. Most families have lived here for generations. The first &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; people that came to town were with that gas company that built a few years back.  I ask &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; if business has been good.   We were doing pretty good until recently. Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment. Then we started having all this trouble with the crops.  In what way, I asked.  The crops aren't producing like they have in the past. It took a while to figure out, then one of the city &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt;rs figured out to call in a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; specialist. When they tested it they said the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; was &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ated.  Bodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had to head back home. The tractor had to be fixed before they could work the next day. I thanked him and watched him climb into his truck and head out of town. The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; specialist turned out to be the international agency &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Wellness&lt;/FONT&gt; For All , an international agency with a mission to bring healthy &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development. I caught up with a representative from &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Wellness&lt;/FONT&gt; for All the next day. &lt;b&gt;Joclyn&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; is project coordinator for &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Wellness&lt;/FONT&gt; for All . She spoke to me over a satellite call from her field &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; in Southeast Asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. Ms. &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.  We were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt;. In the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen. The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; drinking &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; comes from the &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; River, as does all the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; for farming, so we looked for a source upstream. We found sources of production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream. Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins.   Can these substances occur naturally? I asked her.  Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly. Ground&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ation is usually the result of human activity. The GAStech pipes are releasing &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ants into a pond. The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; River from which the residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; draw their drinking &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; and irrigation for the crops.   Did you talk to GAStech about this?   Oh yes, she replied. At first we believed we were gaining traction. We met several times with GAStech representatives, including one of the senior executives, &lt;b&gt;Hank&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Fluss.&lt;/b&gt;  He personally assured us GAStech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts. After a time, though, it became clear that while Mr. &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; was earnest it was &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; who makes the decisions. It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, or the environment.  &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge,&lt;/b&gt;  Jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices.  When we didn't make headway with GAStech, &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; continued, the community &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;s decided to approach the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of Kronos for assistance. Per our policy -and with permission from the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;s - we published the test results in an official public document. The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;s then approached the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis. Our agency assured them we would again be available to help in any way when those agreements were finalized.  At this point Ms &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; was called away from the phone, so I returned to my editor friend, Pondo Reese to tell finish the story. Part Three will be published May 15, 1998

Petrus Gerhard  1998/05/15   I've asked him to tell me about the involvement of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of Kronos in the deeply troubling account of a community's struggle for protection from those who should help them the most: their elected officials, against those who would &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;poison&lt;/FONT&gt; their children and the country's food. He called every department that could possibly be associated with our problem: &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;interior&lt;/FONT&gt;, justice, foreign affairs, health.   Reese then describes months of meetings at which the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt officials &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;demand&lt;/FONT&gt;ed documents proving their case: health and crop yield statistics, the scientific test results from &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Wellness&lt;/FONT&gt; For All, and medical records.

 Daily Pegasus  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, KRONOS: AID of one divides two of the SOURCE UNEXPECTED    1998/04/27   This article is the second installation of a series of three parts that deals with the problem every greater time an anguish of the community, the criminal fact of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations in the country of Kronos.  I took for above with &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; in the city that made purchases in the warehouse of the hardware of &lt;b&gt;Ferro&lt;/b&gt; to repair an broken tractor. &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; has cultivated the soybeans its whole life, like its father and his parents. I asked to him about its life in the farm.   We have worked the Earth during long time - perhaps 200 years, perhaps a small piece more, &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; said to me as it chose on a package of per to us, looking for the right size. On the years we have added some hectares here and there. To us it maintains occupied.   Occupied it is an underestimation, as I found when I punctured to farmer wiry to say to me more.   My wife obtains the ascending cabritos and title to teach, then she will do a little something so that we eat for the lunch and we work next to me until supper. When the children obtain school caretakers make their tasks, and we are all buttocks in the house most of the times by darkness.    We do this most of the days, he we added, with the exception of days of the adoration.   &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; identifies the appropriate bolt and to char it with the teller on cabritos and school whereas it finishes his purchase.   All we know one another one here, &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; we explained whereas we go away. Most of the families they have lived here for the generations. The first &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; people who came to the city were with that company of the gas that constructed the posteriora part of some years.   I request &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; if the business has been good.    We made quite good recently until time. The benefits were good and added cultivated area, or &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt;d the equipment. Then we began to have all this hardship with the harvests.   How, I it requested.   The harvests are not producing as they have in the past. It awhile took the figure towards, outside then one of the calculated officials of the city towards outside calling in a specialist of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt;. They proved when it they said that the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; was &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ated.   Bodrodgi sighed, and with a glance surrounded in its eye thanked for he me by my interest and this it had to me to direct it the back home. I thanked for it I watched and to raise it in its car and head outside city.  The specialist of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; turned out to be the international agency health for all , an international agency with a mission to bring the healthy &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; to the communities caused sorrow by natural disasters, sketch and - coincidently - oil and development of the gas.  I took for above with a representative of the health for all the following day. &lt;b&gt;Joclyn&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; is coordinating of the project for the health for all . She spoke to me on a call based on the satellites of her &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; of the field in Asia South-Eastern where she was efforts of the relevacion of the creation which they followed an earthquake. Ms &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; decided to speak me by some minutes between the meetings on its work in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.   A civil employee of the city on a problem we made contact with enemy whereupon they had with its local &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt;. In years of last agriculture one had collapsed, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had risen. The potable &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; comes from the river of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele,&lt;/b&gt;  like all the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; to cultivate, so we looked for a source against the current. We above find sources of the useless disposition of the production in km of the operation of GAStech by &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt;s. The tests demonstrated to stops levels of the benzene, the tolueno, arsenic of xylene, the lead and the selenium, among other toxins.    These substances Can happen naturally I asked to him.   Not in these amounts, and not this one suddenly. The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ation of the underground &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; is generally the result of the human activity. The pipes of GAStech are sending the polluting agents in a pool. The toxins are forming plume subsurface that leaks in the river of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; of which the residents of the drainage of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; its potable &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; and irrigation for the harvests.    You spoke with GAStech on this    Oh yes, she answered. We thought at the outset that we gained the traction. We solved several times with the representatives of GAStech, including one of the senior executives, &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;hank.&lt;/b&gt;  It assured personally to us that GAStech would act responsible to provide material and financial aid towards efforts of the cleaning. After a time, although, got to be clear that whereas Mr. &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; was serious it was &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; that makes the decisions. It is evident that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest in the well-being of the residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, or the atmosphere.   &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge,&lt;/b&gt;  the Jr, who had inherited his part in the company of his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for the practices of business of cutthroat.   When we did not make progress with GAStech, &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; continued, the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;s of the community decided to approach the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of Kronos for the aid. By our policy - and with the permission of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;s of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; - we published the test resultses in an official public document. The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;s of then &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; approached the officials of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt like citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the scientific analysis. To our he assured them agency that we would be again available to help anyway when those agreements were concluded.   To this point the &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; far from the telephone called ms, so I returned to my friend of the editor, Pondo Reese to tell to end history.  Part three will be published the 15 of May of 1998

 Homeland Illumination &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, KRONOS: WILL THE &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;GOVERNME&lt;/FONT&gt;NT RESPOND IN TIME? Part Three Petrus Gerhard 15 May 1998     This article is the last installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos. Pondo Reese, editor of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; Weekly Journal, stands at his window, looking out toward the sun setting on the &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; River. I've asked him to tell me about the involvement of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of Kronos in the deeply troubling account of a community's struggle for protection from those who should help them the most: their elected officials, against those who would &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;poison&lt;/FONT&gt; their children and the country's food.  It took a long time for anyone to respond, Reese tells me of their struggle. &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; - the man you met - didn't give up. He called every department that could possibly be associated with our problem: &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;interior&lt;/FONT&gt;, justice, foreign affairs, health. &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; and a few other residents made several trips to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt; trying to get someone to listen. Finally, a sympathetic person from the Ministry of Health answered the door, so that's where we started.  Reese then describes months of meetings at which the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt officials &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;demand&lt;/FONT&gt;ed documents proving their case: health and crop yield statistics, the scientific test results from &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Wellness&lt;/FONT&gt; For All, and medical records.  It's been frustrating. We bring the documents they want, and then they want to confirm the results, or tell us to provide additional information or have closed door meetings. We're currently in the process of negotiating a date for a hearing at the Ministry of Health to present our petition for assistance.  Has it been worth it?  You tell me, Reese nods out his window. I look over his shoulder to see a group of children kicking a soccer ball in the dust.  What choice do we have?  
&lt;hr /&gt;
 The Orb  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, KRONOS: HELP of an UNEXPECTED part two of SOURCE    1998/04/27   This article is the second installment of a series in three parts addressing the problem growing of an anguish of the community, the embezzlement of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt, and influences it alarming at the multinational multinationals on the country of Kronos.  I caught up with myself compared to &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; downtown making of the purchases to the &lt;b&gt;ferro&lt;/b&gt; store of material to repair a broken tractor. &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; cultivated soya its life whole, just as his/her father and their fathers. I questioned it about his life with the farm.   We worked the ground for a long time - perhaps 200 years, perhaps a little more, &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; like it indicated to me selected above a container of bolts, seeking the good size. During years we added a few hectares here and there. It maintains occupied to us.   Occupied is an undervaluation, as I found when I stabbed the stiff farmer to say myself more.   Of I head usually to the fields before the sun to the top, Mr. &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; indicates to me. My wife obtains the high children and titrates to inform, then it will do something so that us eat for the lunch and function beside me until the dinner. When the children become at the house of the school they make their drudgeries, and we are all backs at the house the majority of the times by the darkness.    We make these majority of the days, it is added, except days of worship.   &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; identifies the suitable bolt and causes with the cash clerk about the children and of the school while it achieves his purchase.   All let us know We here another, &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; explains while we leave. The majority of the families lived here for generations. The first &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; people who came to the city were with this gas company which established the back of a few years.   I ask &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; if the businesses were good.    We made very good until recently. The benefit were good and we add cultivated surface, or improve the equipment. Then we started to have all this trouble with harvests.   How, I asked.   Harvests do not produce as they have in the past. That removed one moment with the figure, then one of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;s of city illustrated outside to call in a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; specialist. When they examined it they said that &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; was soiled.   Bodrodgi sighed, and with a glance encircled in its eye it thanked me for my interest and says had it to me to direct the back house. The tractor had to be fixed before they could function the next day. I thanked it and observed it rise in its truck and head out of the city.  The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; specialist proved to be the international agency health for all , an international agency with a mission to bring healthy &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; to the communities afflicted by normal disasters, outlines and - coincidentally - oil and formation of gas.  I caught up with myself compared to a representative of health for the whole the next day. &lt;b&gt;Joclyn&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; is a coordinator of project for health for all . It spoke to me above a satellite call its &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; field in South-East Asia where it was efforts of relief of establishment following an earthquake. Mrs. &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; agreed to speak to me during a few minutes between the meetings about their work in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.   We were contacted by a civil servant of city about a problem which they had with &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; their room. In years of the last agriculture was effondue, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had gone up. The drinking &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; comes from the river of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele,&lt;/b&gt;  just as any &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; for the leasing, thus we sought a source upstream. We found sources of provision of reject of production to the km of operation of GAStech ascending. The tests showed the high levels of benzene, toluene, the xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, between other toxins.    Can these substances occur naturally? I asked him.   Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly. The subsoil &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ation is usually the result of the human activity. The pipes of GAStech discharge from the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ants in a pond. The toxins form a feather with ground flower which infiltrates in the river of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; of which residents of the aspiration of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; their drinking &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; and irrigation for harvests.    You spoke in GAStech on this subject?   The OH yes, it answered. In the beginning we believed that we gain traction. We met several times with representatives of GAStech, including one of the senior executive, &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;hank.&lt;/b&gt;  It personally ensured us that GAStech would act in a responsible way to provide to the material aid and financial worms of the efforts of cleaning. After one moment, although, it appeared clearly that while Mr. &lt;b&gt;Fluss&lt;/b&gt; was serious it was &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; which makes the decisions.

When we did not make progress with GAStech, &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; continued, the chiefs of the community decided to approach the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of Kronos for the assistance.

Our agency ensured that we would be still available to help in some way when these agreements were completed.   In this moment Mrs. &lt;b&gt;Reynolds&lt;/b&gt; was called part of the telephone, thus I returned to my friend of writer, Pondo Reese for saying to completion the history.

Pondo Reese, writer of the weekly &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt;spaper of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, is held with its window, looking at outside towards the sun placing on the river of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele.&lt;/b&gt;  I asked him to say to me deeply about the participation of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of Kronos in the alarming account of the fight of a community for protection against those which should help them more: their elected civils servant, counters those which would &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;poison&lt;/FONT&gt; their children and the food of the country.

It had frustrated. We bring the documents which they want, and then they want to confirm the results, or indicate to us to provide additional information or to have declared meetings closed of door. We are currently in the course of negotiating a date for a hearing with the ministry for health to present our petition for the assistance.   Was it in value it?

No local residents were injured as well and though some residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; were evacuated from their homes the investigation indicates that the evacuation was unnecessary.   While the official cause of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;explosion&lt;/FONT&gt; is still under investigation, the problem may have come from a defect in the wellhead itself.

 The Orb  The MEASUREMENT Of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;TAX&lt;/FONT&gt;ES DEMOLISHED, EFFORTS OF FIXED &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; A    2001/03/24   &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt;, Kronos - a measurement to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;tax&lt;/FONT&gt;es on the foreign development of oil and gas proposed by &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Minister&lt;/FONT&gt; of health &lt;b&gt;Cesare&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Nespola&lt;/b&gt; was demolished by a broad margin last week in the General meeting.  This defeat is a hard blow with the guards of Kronos, a group of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; which counted on this placing to provide the cleaning of care of health and environment of their &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; of drinks and irrigation.   We hold a meeting envisaged with the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;minister&lt;/FONT&gt;, of the guards of the Chief of Kronos that &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; indicated. Not to still count to us outside. We project to improve measurement and the &lt;b&gt;Nespola&lt;/b&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;minister&lt;/FONT&gt; will reintroduce it at the end of this year.   &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; is the chief of the guards of Kronos, an environmental group of bases with a mission to reverse the pollution caused by gas drilling at its birthplace. </event>

 Homeland Illumination &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; MEMBERS &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ARREST&lt;/FONT&gt;ED Petrus Gerhard 31 August 2001  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, Kronos - &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt heavies obstructed the free speech - yet again - of members of the activist group Protectors of Kronos yesterday at a lawful demonstration at the &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; Bend fields. The five &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; activists had gathered in front of the gates to GAStech gas drilling operations facility to bring public awareness about the polluted &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; River which has caused health problems to the residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;. Bystanders report that the demonstration had begun peacefully with the five &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; members walking back and forth across the road, chanting Remember &lt;b&gt;Juliana!&lt;/b&gt; and No more &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;poison&lt;/FONT&gt;!  An eyewitness told the Homeland Illumination that when the gates opened to allow GAStech company vehicles to exit the facility the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ers moved aside. Witnesses agree that at the same time vehicles with the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of Kronos seal drove to the gates, apparently planning to enter the facility.   It was all very civil up till then, &lt;b&gt;Griffith&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Mabel,&lt;/b&gt;  an &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; resident who had come out to support the &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; told the Homeland Illumination. The gates opened, the &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; people moved and the trucks drove out. That's when it got weird. The trucks stopped in the middle of the road for no reason.  Another eyewitness, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; farmer &lt;b&gt;Charley&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Normand&lt;/b&gt; adds, Yeah, the &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; guys asked the drivers to move nicely, but the GAStech drivers ignored them. They had their windows down, so it wasn't like they couldn't hear them.  The occupants of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt vehicles exited and joined the altercation. The sequence of events becomes confusing at this point. Some witnesses state the GAStech drivers instigated arguments with the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ors, and others think the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt officials began to strong arm the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ers from the road.  Turns out the people in the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt cars were &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Mabel&lt;/b&gt; tells the Homeland Illumination. They wore uniforms and had badges.  Onlookers tell the Homeland Illumination that the three parties began yelling, and at some point the Kronos &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; - presumably from &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt;- &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;arrest&lt;/FONT&gt;ed the five activists and transported them to an &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; jail. Despite repeated requests for an interview, the Homeland Illumination has not been granted access to those &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;arrest&lt;/FONT&gt;ed.

 The Orb  THE MEMBERS OF &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; STOPPED    2001/09/01   &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, Kronos - heavies of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt blocked the free speech - once again - members of the guards of group of activist of Kronos yesterday to a legal demonstration with the fields of curve of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele.&lt;/b&gt;  The five activists of &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; had met in front of the doors with the service of drilling of gas operations of GAStech to bring the public conscience about the polluted river of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; which posed problems of health to the residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.  The spectators report that the demonstration had started peacefully with the five members of &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; going in the two directions through the road, singing remember &lt;b&gt;Juliana!&lt;/b&gt; and more &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;poison&lt;/FONT&gt;!   An eyewitness said that when the doors opened to make it possible vehicles of company of GAStech to leave the service the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ers moved on side. The witnesses agree that at the same time the vehicles with the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of the joint of Kronos led to the doors, apparently projecting to write the service.    It was all the very civil one upwards until then, &lt;b&gt;Griffith&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Mabel,&lt;/b&gt;  a resident of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; which had left to support the &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; said. The opened doors, the people of &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; moved and the trucks drove out. It is when it obtained strange. The trucks stopped in the middle of the road for any reason.   Another eyewitness, farm &lt;b&gt;Charley&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Normand&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; adds, ouais, the types of &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; asked the drivers to move well, but the drivers of GAStech were unaware of them. They had their windows downwards, thus it was not as they could not hear them.   The occupants of the vehicles of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt left and joined the argument. The sequence of operations becomes muddling in this moment. Some witnesses state the arguments incited by drivers of GAStech with the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ateurs, and others think that the civils servant of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt started to make to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;violenc&lt;/FONT&gt;e the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ers of the road.

It carried uniforms and had badges.   The spectators say that the three parts started to howl, and at a certain point the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; force of Kronos - probably of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt;- stopped the five activists and transported to a prison of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.  In spite of the requests repeated for an interview, one did not grant access to those stopped.    
&lt;hr /&gt;
 Worldwise  The activists disturb the traffic close to the fields of curve of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt;    2001/09/01     &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ABILA&lt;/FONT&gt;, Kronos - five young people were stopped yesterday to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt; close to the entry to the fields of curve of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; while they &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;claim&lt;/FONT&gt;ed the action of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt to address their environmental concern concerning the operations of GAStech to the site.

 Daily Pegasus  THE MEMBERS OF &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ARREST&lt;/FONT&gt;ED    2001/09/02   &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ELODIS&lt;/FONT&gt;, Kronos - heavies of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt obstructed the free speech - yet again - of the members of the protectors of the group of the activist of Kronos yesterday in a legal demonstration in the fields of the curve of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele.&lt;/b&gt;  The five activists of &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; had collected in front of the doors to the facility of the operations of the gas of GAStech that he perforated to cause to public conscience the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ated river of &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; that has caused problems of health to the residents of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.  The present people disclose that the demonstration had begun Pacific with the five members of &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; that walked forwards and backwards through way, singing remembers &lt;b&gt;Julian&lt;/b&gt; and not more of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;poison&lt;/FONT&gt;   An eyewitness said that when the doors were opened to allow that the vehicles of the company of GAStech leave the facility the moved demonstrators to a side. The witnesses apparently agree that at the same time the vehicles with the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of the seal of Kronos lead to the doors, gliding to incorporate the facility.    Era all the very civil one for above until then, &lt;b&gt;Griffith&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Mabel,&lt;/b&gt;  resident of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; that had left to support the &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; said. The opened doors, the &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; people moved and the cars expelled. That one is when stranger obtained. The cars stopped in means of the way for no reason.   Another eyewitness, farmer &lt;b&gt;Charley&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Normand&lt;/b&gt; de &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; adds, yes, the &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; individuals requested that the conductors moved pleasant, but the conductors of GAStech did not pay attention to them. They had his windows down, so he was not as they could not hear them.   The renters of the vehicles of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt left and assembled of altercation. The event sequence gets to be confused at this point. Some witnesses indicate the instigadas discussions the conductors of GAStech with &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ors, and others think that the officials of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt began to intimidate the demonstrators of the way.   It is to people in the cars of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt were &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Mabel&lt;/b&gt; says. He used the uniforms and had currencies.   The Onlookers says that the three parties began to shout, and in a certain point the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; of Kronos - of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt;- it &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;arrest&lt;/FONT&gt;ed five activists it probably transported and them to a jail of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.  In spite of the repeated orders an interview, has not granted the access those &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;arrest&lt;/FONT&gt;ed.

The witnesses report that demonstration peacefully started &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; with the five members were that alternating concerning the way run, chanting remind &lt;b&gt;Juliana!&lt;/b&gt; and no longer vergift!   An eye told which then the poorten which are opened to permit company vehicles to GAStech moved the facility to leave aside &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ers. The witnesses are it once that tezelfdertijd the vehicles with the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of connection floated Kronos to the poorten, apparently of plan are the facility enter.   It was going up to then, &lt;b&gt;Griffith&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Mabel&lt;/b&gt; already very civil, a resident &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; who was from &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; come support told. The opened poorten, people &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; moved themselves and the freight carriages dissipated. That is then the bizar became. The freight carriages stopped in the middle of the way for no reason.  Another eye, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; farmer add &lt;b&gt;Charley&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Normand&lt;/b&gt; yes, the kerels &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; asked move itself the drivers neatly, but the drivers GAStech ignored them. They had their windows, so that it was not if she could not hear them.  The occupants of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt vehicles left and dovetailed themselves the dispute. The consecution of events becomes on this point confusing. Some witnesses explain exhorted arguments GAStech with &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ors to the drivers, and others think the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt civil servants of strong weapon with &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ers of the way started.  People in the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt cars prove to be &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; force were, &lt;b&gt;Mabel&lt;/b&gt; tell.

Kronos was horrified from north to south by the hideous crime committed by the POK, Mr. &lt;b&gt;Drymiau&lt;/b&gt; said.  This was in context of dangerous escalation to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;violenc&lt;/FONT&gt;e against Kronos and Kronosians and a clear declaration by the &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; that it knows nothing but &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;violenc&lt;/FONT&gt;e.

The declaration passed GAStech in reply to the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt; collection of Wednesday &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; at the hoofdkwartier - Kronos.

In a long declaration &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; Jr. its argument makes up, if a person is prepared on private possession, violate if a person is prepared to a door to chain to prevent if matter, a person is prepared to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;break&lt;/FONT&gt; windows and cars in its own city to burn, then has been prepared in functioning that person to put do no matter what. And if a person is prepared no matter what to do their eventual aim realize then to beat they apprehension in the common citizen. I fear what they will do afterwards because I fear what they arranged for to be. When a group people uses apprehension and &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;violenc&lt;/FONT&gt;e their eventual aim to realize word there is only one for them and that word is &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;terror&lt;/FONT&gt;ist.

We were promised better jobs, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; roads, better healthcare and a better standard of living, said one 20-year old &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;or who declined to have her name used. All I see are bigger mansions for the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;minister&lt;/FONT&gt;s and a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;hospital&lt;/FONT&gt; that costs more to fix than it can make. We won't accept that!

The non-profit &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;hospital&lt;/FONT&gt; has had difficulty maintaining its infrastructure, despite the extensive restoration performed sevearl years ago to replace the electrical and plumbing systems.

He was led - manacled - from a meeting of the Protectors of Kronos in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, a rural township west of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt;. Demonstrating his trademark humor, &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, I guess I shouldn't have sent the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;t those cases of bottled &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; for his birthday.  &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; is the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt; of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; that has &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;demand&lt;/FONT&gt;ed the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt clean up the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ated &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; caused by gas drilling in their community.  We didn't ask for GAStech to come to our community, &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; spoke at a rally a few months ago. We didn't ask for our &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; to become undrinkable, for our children to become &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;sick&lt;/FONT&gt;. Neither &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; nor the people of Kronos have received any benefit from the extraordinarily large amount of money that GAStech clears every year. I ask: Where is the money going?  The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; representative assured supporters who massed outside the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; station that &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see &lt;b&gt;Karel.&lt;/b&gt;   He's a determined man, Karel's attorney Michale &lt;b&gt;Kraft&lt;/b&gt; told me over the phone. He'll fight these false charges and be out in a few days. He'll probably &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;complain&lt;/FONT&gt; about the jail food at the next &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; rally.  &lt;b&gt;Kraft&lt;/b&gt; plans to meet with &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; Saturday morning.

It was carried out - manacled - starting from a meeting of the guards of Kronos in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, rural black suburbs external &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt;.  Showing its mood of trade mark, &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; raised its wrists and joked with its defenders as it is carried out far, I guess that I should not have sent to the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;t these cases &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; bottled for his birthday.   &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; is the chief of the guards of Kronos, an alliance of the citizens of Kronos d' &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; which required the clean top of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt the soiled &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; caused by gas drilling in their community.   We did not ask GAStech to come to our community, spoke of &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; to a gathering a few months ago. Nous' did not ask our &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; to become undrinkable, so that our children become &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;sick&lt;/FONT&gt;. Neither &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; nor the people of Kronos received any advantage of the amount of money extraordinarily large only GAStech releases each year. I ask: Where is the active money?   The assured defenders representative of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; force who piled up apart from the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; station that &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; would be treated with humanity, but refused to answer questions or to allow visitors to see &lt;b&gt;Karel.&lt;/b&gt;    He is a determined man, the agent of &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; that Michale &lt;b&gt;Kraft&lt;/b&gt; indicated to me above the telephone. It will fight these false expenses and will be outside in a few days. He will probably &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;complain&lt;/FONT&gt; about food about prison to the next gathering about POK.   &lt;b&gt;Kraft&lt;/b&gt; projects to meet the morning of &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; Saturday.

During the press conference &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge,&lt;/b&gt;  Jr. spoke of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; logo - a tri-part blue flame - that is reminiscent of a leaf to help position GAStech and its products as a clean fuel alternative. He also referenced that the tri-part flame represents the past, present, and future of the company in that by keeping one eye on the past we know from where we came - our humble beginnings; one eye on the future we will know where we are going - our coming success; and both feet planted in the present we will be proactive in an ever-changing, competitive industry.   Finally, &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge,&lt;/b&gt;  Jr. asserted GAStech International's blue flame is an enduring beacon of environmental responsibility, and a symbol of a clean energy business moving forward.   This rebranding process and &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; logo seem to be in response to recent trouble the multi-national gas giant has been struggling with in Kronos including the February 19 &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt; at GAStech - Kronos' headquarters of 200 people who blocked entrance to the building, resulting in several &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;arrest&lt;/FONT&gt;s.

He deflected, Today is a great day for GAStech. I won't let the day be derailed by unfounded, borderline libelous, allegations. </event>

He was expecting to be released in the next few days and return to his work with the Protectors of Kronos, and was excited to continue the Protectors of Kronos mission to which he dedicated his life. I can assure you that Elian's death will be investigated with all the resources at our disposal and those responsible will be brought to justice.  Supporters of the &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; and others began gathering outside the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; station as &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt;s spread.  I can't believe it, Kriste Brontes said through her tears, We were at the rally in March. He looked and sounded so good. He was so optimistic that changes were coming.

The &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; assembly began peacefully enough with the usual chanted slogans and waving of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt; signs, but then one young rabble-rouser grabbed a bullhorn and began inciting the crowd to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;violenc&lt;/FONT&gt;e. The crowd smashed windows and vandalized shops in the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Siopa&lt;/FONT&gt; area, set &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;fire&lt;/FONT&gt;s in the streets, and clashed with &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt;. Additional &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; forces responded to contain the chaos and they were forced to use rubber bullets and tear gas in order to disperse the crowds.  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;t Kapelou's &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; released a statement about the rally, stating, This sort of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;violenc&lt;/FONT&gt;e will not be condoned.

However, the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;s have turned violent with smashed windows and vandalized shops.  Countless shop windows smashed in and around &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Siopa&lt;/FONT&gt;, the downtown shopping area. A general sense of chaos broke out with chanting &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ers, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;fire&lt;/FONT&gt;s, and fleeing citizens.   A unifying theme of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ers was the chanted slogans including Justice for &lt;b&gt;Elian&lt;/b&gt; in reference to previously mentioned activist &lt;b&gt;Elian&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; and Remember &lt;b&gt;Juliana&lt;/b&gt; , a young girl from &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; who &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;d in 1998 allegedly from the effects of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ation. Several buildings were defaced with the above mentioned slogans as well.  The Kronos &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt issued a statement, This sort of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;violenc&lt;/FONT&gt;e will not be condoned.

What I can say you is that when I left &lt;b&gt;Elian&lt;/b&gt; yesterday after meeting it in the prison it was in excellent health and the good spirits. It hoped to be released in the days to come and the return to its work with the guards from Kronos, and was excited to continue the guards of the mission of Kronos to which it devoted its life. I can ensure you that the death of &lt;b&gt;Elian&lt;/b&gt; will be stu&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;d with all resources at our disposal and these persons in charge will be brought to justice.

Nevertheless, the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;s have given to violent return with the broken windows and the destroyed stores.    The countless windows of the store broke in and around &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Siopa&lt;/FONT&gt;, the centric area of purchases. A general sense of the chaos exploded with the demonstrators who sang, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;fire&lt;/FONT&gt;s, and the citizens who fled.     A subject of the unification of the demonstrators was the mottos sung including justice for &lt;b&gt;Elian&lt;/b&gt; in reference to the activist previously mentioned &lt;b&gt;Elian&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; and to remember &lt;b&gt;Julian&lt;/b&gt; , a young girl of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; that &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;d in 1998 alleged of the effects of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ation of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt;.

Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; supporters gathered in front of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Police&lt;/FONT&gt; Station, holding photographs of &lt;b&gt;Elian,&lt;/b&gt;  and of another young martyr, &lt;b&gt;Juliana&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Vann,&lt;/b&gt;  the ten-year old girl who &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;d in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt;.  Both of them &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;d because of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt lies and corruption, one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; retaliation. &lt;b&gt;Juliana&lt;/b&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;d because Kronos allowed GAStech to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;poison&lt;/FONT&gt; our &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Elian&lt;/b&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;d because he tried to bring &lt;b&gt;Juliana&lt;/b&gt; justice. When will it end? Another, larger crowd had gathered the day before in a nearby city park to bring public awareness about these same issues. Amid the speeches and music, I heard the same message from the year before: Remember &lt;b&gt;Juliana!&lt;/b&gt; Remember Elian!</event>

Its agent, Michale &lt;b&gt;Kraft&lt;/b&gt; make several aspects in front of the court require that the contour of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt that their detail charges, and &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; release. &lt;b&gt;Kraft&lt;/b&gt; had concluded an agreement with the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt that expenses would be reduced and &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; is released while waiting for a test, but &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;d during two days before it was to go freely.  The questions are delayed, however, about the way of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;d of &lt;b&gt;Karel.&lt;/b&gt;  Requests of information were met insurances that the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; force - whose &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; guard was inside per hour of its death - would make very possible to carry out a thorough research.  This complete research lasted every two weeks, including time when it took the coroner of town of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt; to lose the original files of autopsy. After the body of &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; was incinerated and sent to its family in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;, the chief of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt; of the name of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; force closed the bag and refused to answer questions about the death of &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; declaring that we are satisfied death were normal causes and will not amuse any more of the investigations.   As paid per hour of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;d of &lt;b&gt;Karel,&lt;/b&gt;  several people close to research reported that the body of &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; showed signs of trauma blunted of force, abrasions and lacerations what were not formed with the cause of the death brought back by the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; force. These confidential sources since moved sector and were inalienable for the contact.  The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; force refused with something not very common product in the death of &lt;b&gt;Karel&lt;/b&gt; and the civils servant of city &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;claim&lt;/FONT&gt; the charges of the murder and unjustified death are affirmed by &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; brew-rousers to try to encourage instability and &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;violenc&lt;/FONT&gt;e.  Yesterday the morning of June 19, a small group of defenders of &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; collected in front of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; station of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt;, holding of the photographs of &lt;b&gt;Elian,&lt;/b&gt;  and another young martyrdom, &lt;b&gt;Juliana&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Vann,&lt;/b&gt;  ten years - the old maid who &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;d in 1998 of cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt;.    Both &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;d because of the lies of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt and the corruption, a man indicated to me who asked that its named either retained because of the preoccupations with a revenge of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; force. &lt;b&gt;Juliana&lt;/b&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;d because Kronos made it possible GAStech to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;poison&lt;/FONT&gt; our &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt;, and dead &lt;b&gt;Elian&lt;/b&gt; because it tried to bring the justice of &lt;b&gt;Juliana.&lt;/b&gt;  When it finishes?   Others, a larger crowd had collected the front day in park close to city to bring the public conscience about these same questions. Among the speeches and the music, I heard the same message of the year before: To remember &lt;b&gt;Juliana!&lt;/b&gt; To remember &lt;b&gt;Elian!&lt;/b&gt;

That was despite strong levels of investment, reaching a record last year and sustained this year.

The average cost of extracting a barrel of oil was up by 27% in only a year, to reach K17. The number of fields with cost per barrel above K30 has doubled in the last 12 months. Rising costs were cited last week by GAStech, which is considering future investments in Norway and North America, rather than Kronos fields. With rising costs, production &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;tax&lt;/FONT&gt; payments to the Kronos Treasury are expected to fall from K3.5bn during the 2011-12 financial year to K2bn in the current year. Following the rapid decline in oil and gas production from Kronos fields in recent years, the rate of fall slowed during 2012 - down by 8% to .83m barrels of oil per day, or its gas equivalent.

 The Continent  Oil and the gas the industry has warned of Kronos it for its most formidable challenge in 20 years because of the low levels of exploration stands.    2012/02/21   The energy civil servants of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt said previous year to only 15 wells were bored.  That was in spite of strong levels of investment, which a report reaches previous year and supported this year.  Drilling of the exploration had been suffered of 26 wells six years, only sufficient to a fractie of the valued oil and recover the gas to which on country oil and the gasvelden remain.  The areas of Kronos contain an abundance of still oil and gas to find and it is critical we finds the resources to the current state of exploration turn around - energy ad&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;minister&lt;/FONT&gt;s Jules &lt;b&gt;Jecovic&lt;/b&gt;  The annual activity research oil and gas Kronos found a fast &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt; of production costs, previous year omhoog by 15%.  To the average to cost to obtain oil a barrel was omhoog by 27% in only one year, to reach K17.  The number of areas with costs by barrel above K30 has doubled in the last 12 months.  The increasing costs were quoted last week GAStech, which order future investments in Norway and Noord-Amerika, rather than Kronos consider.  With increasing costs, the payments of the production &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;tax&lt;/FONT&gt; to the Treasury Kronos must fall of K3.5bn during the budget year of 2011-12 to K2bn in the current year.  After the fast fall in oil and gasproductie of areas Kronos the last years, slowed down the tariff of fall during 2012 - by 8% up to .83m barrels oil per day, or are gasequivalent.  Most important tale remains the reading	  &lt;b&gt;Jecovic&lt;/b&gt; explained the areas of Kronos contain an abundance of oil and gas still to find and it we find the resources criticism are the current change state of exploration. The availability and the access of the material up to capital are the two important barriers which are noted by our ministry.   </event>

 Everyday &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;New&lt;/FONT&gt;s  The industry of the oil and the gas of Kronos has noticed that it faces his greater challenge of 20 years of due to the low levels of the exploration.    2012/02/22   The civil employees of the energy of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt said that only 15 wells were perforated the last year.  That was in spite of strong levels of the investment, reaching a year last of registry and maintained east year.  Perforating of the exploration was down from 26 wells six years ago, it is only sufficient to recover a fraction of the considered oil and to provide with remaining gas in the countries oil and the gas fields.  The fields of Kronos contain an abundance of oil and the gas still that will be and she is critical we find means to give return around to the present state of the exploration - of energy &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;minister&lt;/FONT&gt; Julio &lt;b&gt;Jecovic&lt;/b&gt;  The annual survey on the activity by Oil and the gas Kronos found an &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt; fast in production costs, above for of 15% the last year.  The average cost to extract an oil barrel was in favor for above of only 27% of a year, to reach K17.  The number of fields with cost by barrel on K30 has doubled in the 12 last months.  The increasing prices were mentioned the week last through GAStech, that is considering the future investments in Norway and North America, rather that the fields of Kronos.  With increasing prices, one hopes that the payments of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;tax&lt;/FONT&gt; from the production to the Property of Kronos lower of K3.5bn during budgetary exercise 2011-12 to K2bn in the present year.

 Homeland Illumination &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; REMEMBERS MARTYRED &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;LEADER&lt;/FONT&gt; Petrus Gerhard 20 June 2012  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ABILA&lt;/FONT&gt;, Kronos - In a touching ceremony Wednesday &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;s of the activist group Protectors of Kronos paid tribute to their fallen &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Elian&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Karel,&lt;/b&gt;  who was murdered on 19 June 2009 while being illegally detained in a Kronos jail.  Today we gather to remember &lt;b&gt;Elian&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Karel,&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Silvia&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Marek&lt;/b&gt; told the rapt assembly, many of whom held up white candles in Karel's honor.  &lt;b&gt;Elian&lt;/b&gt; was born on an &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; farm not 40 minutes from here, to &lt;b&gt;Jeroen&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Antaura&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Karel.&lt;/b&gt;  He grew up with the specter of death all around him. By the time &lt;b&gt;Elian&lt;/b&gt; was 17 many of his family members and friends were battling constant illness, including his neighbor 10-year old &lt;b&gt;Juliana&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Vann.&lt;/b&gt;   &lt;b&gt;Marek&lt;/b&gt; paused a moment to allow the cries of Remember &lt;b&gt;Juliana!&lt;/b&gt; to fade.  &lt;b&gt;Elian&lt;/b&gt; devoted his life to the people of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; as well as all citizens of Kronos, as did his father before him. &lt;b&gt;Elian&lt;/b&gt; k&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; his would be a difficult journey. He had watched his father, &lt;b&gt;Jeroen&lt;/b&gt; and the founder of the POK, &lt;b&gt;Henk&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bodrogi&lt;/b&gt; walk the very path he would tread. &lt;b&gt;Elian&lt;/b&gt; k&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; the course would not be easy, and would leave little time for a personal life. Yet he chose to take those steps despite the challenges he k&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt; he would face.   Elian's journey ended three years ago today. But his dream did not &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt; with him. And it is that vision of a healthy and prosperous future for all we are here today to honor.  Over the course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only &lt;b&gt;Elian,&lt;/b&gt;  but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe brought about by greed and corruption of public officials.  The gathering was marred only by the aggravating presence of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; in riot gear. The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; agitated many of the crowd, causing them to have to leave the assembly rather than be assailed with batons and pepper spray.

Several dozen of their supporters held sit-ins in front of the capitol building and the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;tial manor, while others took to the streets with their signs and chants. &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ors handed out flyers to bystanders that alleged that our &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt is corrupt and the rich get richer on the backs of the poor . &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Police&lt;/FONT&gt; called for the peaceful end to the sit-ins, but were answered with a barrage of rocks and bottles from the crowd.

People heading to a pro-&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt counter-rally were attacked by &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; supporters, and later shots were &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;fire&lt;/FONT&gt;d.

A group of younger &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ors attacked vehicles, smashing windows. Minor injuries were reported.  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Police&lt;/FONT&gt; reinforcements were sent to the area and blocked roads, and skirmishes between the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; and &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ors broke out.  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Police&lt;/FONT&gt; used tear gas to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;break&lt;/FONT&gt; up the unruly crowd. &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt spokesmen complemented the security forces for their handling of the gangs of criminals disrupting the peace.

 The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt; Post WHO ARE THE &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;PROTEST&lt;/FONT&gt;ERS   22 August 2012   &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ABILA&lt;/FONT&gt;, Kronos - With the third anniversary of &lt;b&gt;Elian&lt;/b&gt; Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ers? But not only who are they, what and why are they &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;ing?   The Protectors of Kronos or &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; were founded in 1997 by residents of rural &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; on the advice of the now defunct &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Wellness&lt;/FONT&gt; for All (&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;WFA&lt;/FONT&gt;), an international &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; safety group. The &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; was initiated to bring attention to the clean &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; issues surrounding &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; to the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of Kronos and the world. The &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; asserts that GAStech International's &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ation of drinking &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.   In 1998, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;WFA&lt;/FONT&gt; performed testing on the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; finding high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The testing a subsequent statement released by &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;WFA&lt;/FONT&gt; brought international attention and pressure on the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt and GAStech to act. However, with the fragmenting of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;WFA&lt;/FONT&gt; due to funding issues, the POK's &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;demand&lt;/FONT&gt;s were largely ignored and downplayed.   Also in 1998, &lt;b&gt;Juliana&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Vann,&lt;/b&gt;  a previously healthy ten-year old girl &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;d of a lingering illness, which &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;WFA&lt;/FONT&gt;-funded doctors &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;claim&lt;/FONT&gt;ed was caused by &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;contamin&lt;/FONT&gt;ation. The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of Kronos officially refuted the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;claim&lt;/FONT&gt; citing the fragmentation of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;WFA&lt;/FONT&gt; organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted.

We have had at least two dozen cases in the last month, said Alicia Bianca, nurse manager of the department. We are literally overwhelmed.  Bianca said she has never seen this level of activity related to drug overdoses in the seven years she has managed the Emergency Department and in the 20 years she has been a nurse. Authorities in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt; said cotton candy may have been a factor in the death of 54-year-old &lt;b&gt;Ralf&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Potter,&lt;/b&gt;  whose bruised and naked body was found February 4 along a dead-end road. Investigators are awaiting toxicology reports to determine the cause of his death. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to Cotton Candy according to the Kronos National &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Poison&lt;/FONT&gt; Center. Patients are coming to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt; General from throughout the greater city region, and they include adults and youths, male and female, and all socio-economic backgrounds, Bianca said.

We went from zero calls to a handful of calls in the last month, he said. Bianca and &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Arrest&lt;/FONT&gt;a said their efforts to treat people is made more difficult because they often do not know anything about the designer drugs that were taken.  You don't know what you're getting when you get it, Bianca said. We have had patients come in and act out of control, who are very violent. They tell us they have been doing cotton candy or synthetic marijuana.  Bianca said there is little clinical data on the effects of cotton candy, as it is an emerging toxicant. There are no controlled stu&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;s in toxicology, she said. The national &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;poison&lt;/FONT&gt; center collects anecdotal reports on overdoses from &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;hospital&lt;/FONT&gt;s and other providers as part of efforts to offer advice on how to treat patients. Designer drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingre&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;nt in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. It is another way to sell it, she said. The term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat. The drug has been sold under the name of Spice Dreams one week and under the name of Tulip Blossom the next.  The Kronos &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. The drugs are sold online as herbal therapy products and are available over the counter in area stores.  We still don't know what you are getting with cotton candy. The chemical composition varies from package to package, Bianca said. One factor for the popularity of cotton candy is its low cost, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166. Cotton candy creates euphoria, or a high, that is equal to or greater than that of cocaine but also causes a crash that is worse, Bianca said. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. They crave it, she said. After repeated use, the drug fries a person's brain, draining the chemicals that balance its operations. This sometimes leads to bizarre, often psychotic behavior that has been reported in the media, such as the case of the naked man in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt; who was found running down the middle of a major highway, Bianca said. The seizures and delusions are incredible, she said. While it is not yet certain who is behind the distribution of this round of designer drugs, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; suspect organized crime is pursuing this large income source. The &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Asterian&lt;/FONT&gt; People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.  </event>

The GAStech empire owns 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company farms, runs gyms, and offers subsidised holidays in Black Sea resorts for key employees. There is an argument, however, that the energy business is different from other industries, requiring energy corporations to operate in distinct ways.   Working in far-off places with no previous infrastructure means oil and gas sites will always be, to some extent, company towns. GAStech certainly strives to ensure its employees can move in and out of these locations by operating a private fleet of four planes to ferry its staff the huge distances between sites.

Petrus Gerhard 20 June 2013  &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;ABILA&lt;/FONT&gt;, Kronos - Yesterday, as they have each June 19th for the past three years supporters of Protectors of Kronos rallied &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;demand&lt;/FONT&gt;ing much the same as they have in the past fourteen years: an end to the corruption of the Kronos &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt officials and the cleanup of the toxic waste dump that has become the &lt;b&gt;Tiskele&lt;/b&gt; River near &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;.  The rally which took place at several venues across the city, including in front of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;t Kapelou's publically-owned home and in front of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt; capital building. The citizens gathered hoping their voices would be heard by their elected officials. They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today's elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Police&lt;/FONT&gt; formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds. On everyone's mind was the question: Who brings a gun to a peaceful sit in? The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness. The most dangerous item in their hands was a picture of a sweet-faced ten year dead old girl - &lt;b&gt;Juliana&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Vann&lt;/b&gt; who &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;die&lt;/FONT&gt;d in 1998 of cancer caused by the benzene in her drinking &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;water&lt;/FONT&gt;.

Despite these heavy-handed efforts, as groups of people slipped through the barricades and moved through the streets to bring their message to the citizens of Kronos. Flyers bringing messages of truth and justice were left on park benches, in coffee houses and on light poles.  How can these officials - hypothetically getting by on public salaries - afford the second homes, large boats and luxury automobiles they flaunt?

Each time the receipt is changed, it leaves indices as for which made. It is like a pedigree.     This particular mixture of the drug MDMC, also known by its street calls the cotton sugar refinery , the spice dreams and the flower of tulip , was found previously only in Asteria but made its manner with the streets of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; and other international countries.

The elder inspector &lt;b&gt;Loblaw&lt;/b&gt; says the public statistics of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; indicate that MDMC is a problem growing with the youth of the country. An &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt; in the problems of mental health, including the hallucinations and paranoia, accompanied by the violent behavior and an &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt; marked in the rates of suicide are only some of the indicators of the use of this drug of originator.      We initially alerted the left civils servant to be on the monitoring for suspicious forwardings of insecticides and cleaning product, the two similar ones in the aspect to MDMC.

Whenever the prescription changes, it leaves tracks as far as it did whom it. It is like a pedigri.     This particular mixture of drug MDMC, also known by its street names the caramel of cotton , the spice sona and the flower of tulipan , was found previously only in Asteria but it has made his way to the streets of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; and other international countries.

Our previous investigations indicated to them like the source of this particular formulation.

These last years the APA has tried to construct to their trade name with Web site and the publication of a professional compartment, of high called quality Arise .    Inspector greater &lt;b&gt;Loblaw&lt;/b&gt; says the public statistic of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; indicates that MDMC is a problem every greater time with the youth of the country. An &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt; in mental problems of health, including the hallucinations and the paranoia, accompanied by violent behavior and an &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt; marked in tariffs of the suicide are only some of the indicators of the use of this drug of designer.      In the first place we have alerted to &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;harbor&lt;/FONT&gt; civil employees to be in the observation post for the suspicious shipments of insecticides and detergent, both similars in aspect to MDMC.

The environmental situation is desperate. The hundreds of rural citizens are suffering the important diseases caused apparently by the exhibition to the useless currents of GAStech, although this one has not been verified civil employee nor recognizes by the company or the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt.   That is what sparked the initial &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt;s in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt; - but empathy with its cause brought demonstrators towards outside in cities through Kronos. Initially pacific, these &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;protest&lt;/FONT&gt; are more and more violent now, and take to the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; and to the citizens in sometimes fatal shooting.

Mrs. &lt;b&gt;Avila&lt;/b&gt; denied that any employee of GAStech was removed. She also denied that they had simply jumped the city with their richness recently discovered.    While the world brought back on December 16, 2013, the public call to the saving initial recent international of GAStech (IPO) produced Net &lt;b&gt;Sten&lt;/b&gt; St. George, Jr. by $1.96 eye-jumping billion for its part control of international company of drilling and exploration of gas.     GAStech - the control of Kronos was also liberally rewarded. The classifications of IPO prove that the executive group gained of the $327.25 collective &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;million&lt;/FONT&gt; of the lately invested shares including/understanding $96.25 &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;million&lt;/FONT&gt; for CFO &lt;b&gt;Ingrid&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Barranco,&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Campo-&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Corrente&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;ADA&lt;/b&gt; of CIO, and the ROUCOULEMENT &lt;b&gt;Orhan&lt;/b&gt; pianotent.

Although Mr. St. George, Jr. an &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; in the centrum maintains, the capital of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;, the majority of international operations of GAStech take place on Kronos including/understanding the production of approximately 5 &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;million&lt;/FONT&gt; cubic meters of gas of daily &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt;spaper.

According to Danisliau, the seven or eight passengers of the first plane were business types and appeared to be in a hurry. It was not exactly clear where they were headed. The plane took off around 12:30 local Kronos time.   The second plane also carried seven or eight business types , but seemed much more relaxed than the first group of passengers . Danisliau said the second group of passengers seemed to be celebrating something. The second plane departed around 14:30 around two hours after the first plane.  Danisliau confirmed that the second plane's destination was Rome, Italy.  Between the two private jets that departed the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt; Airport fourteen to sixteen people could have been passengers. This could easily account for the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;leader&lt;/FONT&gt;ship of GAStech - Kronos.   When asked whether or not the two planes had anything to do with GAStech International Danisliau replied, I don't ask a lot questions. I just fuel the planes.

In this time nobody has &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;demand&lt;/FONT&gt;ed the responsibility of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;kidnap&lt;/FONT&gt;ping. &lt;b&gt;Edvard&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Vann,&lt;/b&gt;  a GAStech - they suspected to the protector security of Kronos that was interrogated and sent after 6 hours, indicated the protectors of Kronos like being the authors behind today events.    An international executive of the greater security of GAStech has been in the site to support the investigation, helping to the department of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; of &lt;b&gt;Avila&lt;/b&gt; and to the officials of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt of Kronos.

The information without confirming of a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;fire&lt;/FONT&gt; in the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; could have served like distraction &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;kidnap&lt;/FONT&gt;ping them or at least to have contributed to the confusion during the event. The cars of the body of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;fire&lt;/FONT&gt;men of &lt;b&gt;Avila&lt;/b&gt; were sent to the headquarters of GAStech - of Kronos around 10:00 this local time of Kronos in the morning to respond to a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;fire&lt;/FONT&gt; alarm.

It is being being accused and being interrogated by 6 hours like member of &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;terror&lt;/FONT&gt;ist &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; one of the worse days of my life. Hardly because a person has he himself name that a criminal does not do him a criminal.     They sent although it not to communicate with the press that &lt;b&gt;Vann&lt;/b&gt; was firm to tensionar its innocence. With about 14 still used of GAStech inexplicable ones, one cannot blame to the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; or the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt not to leave to no stone unturned.

The not confirmed reports/ratios of a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;fire&lt;/FONT&gt; at the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt; could have been used as distraction to the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;kidnap&lt;/FONT&gt;pers or to have at least contributed to confusion during the event.

The apparent confusion stems from the similarity between his name and that of a Protector of Kronos member.  &lt;b&gt;Vann,&lt;/b&gt;  a security guard for GAStech, was furious, stating, I have nothing to do whatsoever with any members of the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;terror&lt;/FONT&gt;ist group POK. I know no one from &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Elodis&lt;/FONT&gt;. I was born here in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt; and I support my &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt and my &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;presiden&lt;/FONT&gt;t. Being accused and being interrogated for 6 hours as a &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;terror&lt;/FONT&gt;ist &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; member is one of the worst days of my life. Just because a person has the same name as a criminal does not make him a criminal.   Though he was instructed not to communicate with the press &lt;b&gt;Vann&lt;/b&gt; was adamant to stress his innocence. With some 14 GAStech employees still unaccounted for, one cannot blame the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; or the &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;governme&lt;/FONT&gt;nt for not leaving any stone unturned.

Local &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt;s organizations have received a ransom note from the &lt;b&gt;POK&lt;/b&gt; &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;claim&lt;/FONT&gt;ing responsibility and &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;demand&lt;/FONT&gt;ing $20 &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Million&lt;/FONT&gt; from the company. It is possible additional &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;demand&lt;/FONT&gt;s are forthcoming. &lt;b&gt;Sanjorge&lt;/b&gt; and the others disappeared following a board meeting at GASTech headquarters. A &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;fire&lt;/FONT&gt; alarm went off, and the execs were discovered missing shortly after that. The complete list of all the unaccounted-for employees has not been released.  &lt;b&gt;John&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Rathburn,&lt;/b&gt;  an American expert on executive &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;kidnap&lt;/FONT&gt;pings who is living in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt;, says that Kronos has not been known as an archetypal country for &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;kidnap&lt;/FONT&gt;ping. However, &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt;d activity by POK, APA [&lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Asterian&lt;/FONT&gt; People's Army], and others in the region have significantly &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;increase&lt;/FONT&gt;d the risk.  The Times's correspondent in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Abila&lt;/FONT&gt; says GASTech &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;office&lt;/FONT&gt;s are closed, and phone calls are being answered but referred to local authorities.  GASTech's corporate headquarters in &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; have refused to comment. However, other &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;new&lt;/FONT&gt;s sources have reported &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;Tethys&lt;/FONT&gt; federal law enforcement officials and staff from the Tethan Ministry of Foreign Affairs have arrived in Kronos to assist &lt;FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow"&gt;police&lt;/FONT&gt; in the investigation.   </event>
